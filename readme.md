# Topic Modeling of Regulatory Documents using Natural Language Processing 


## About

The 2023 Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse had a strong influence on financial regulations. Our project aims to utilize natural language processing topic modeling techniques to identify primary themes in our corpus of financial regulatory documents scraped from [regulations.gov](https://regulations.gov/).

* pandas
* numpy
* os
* re
* json
* sklearn
* nltk
* gensim
* wordcloud
* matplotlib.pyplot
* openai
* keybert
* rake_nltk
* yake
* spacy
* bertopic
* umap

### Methods 
* Keyword Extraction (RAKE, KeyBERT)
* Topic Modeling (BERTopic, LDA)
* Clustering 
* Visualization Techniques 


### Technologies
