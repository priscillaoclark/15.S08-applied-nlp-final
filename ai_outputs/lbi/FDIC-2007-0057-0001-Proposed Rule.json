    "abstract": "The document discusses methods for allocating dividends as part of the implementation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005. It provides a detailed analysis of two allocation methods: the fund balance method and the payments method. These methods determine dividend shares based on factors like the 1996 assessment base and eligible premiums paid after 1996. The analysis includes considerations of risk reduction incentives, treatment of older versus newer institutions, simplicity of methods, decision-making requirements, and potential impacts on institutions chartered in the future. It also invites public comments on the proposed dividend allocation approaches.",
