12 CFR Part 370



RIN 3064-AD37



 
Amendment of the Debt Guarantee Program To Provide for the 

Establishment of a Limited Six-Month Emergency Guarantee Facility



AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).



ACTION: Final rule.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------



SUMMARY: To ensure an orderly phase-out of the Debt Guarantee Program 

(DGP), a component of the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), 

the FDIC is establishing a limited emergency guarantee facility. For 

most insured depository institutions and other entities participating 

in the DGP, the Debt Guarantee Program will conclude on October 31, 

2009, with the FDIC's guarantee expiring no later than December 31, 

2012. To the extent that certain of those entities become unable to 

issue non-guaranteed debt to replace maturing senior unsecured debt 

because of market disruptions or other circumstances beyond their 

control, the emergency guarantee facility will be available on an 

application basis. In order to utilize the emergency guarantee 

facility, an entity must apply to, and receive prior approval from, the 

FDIC. If the application is approved, the FDIC will guarantee the 

applicant's senior unsecured debt issued on or before April 30, 2010. 

Debt guaranteed under the emergency guarantee facility will be subject 

to an annualized assessment rate equal to a minimum of 300 basis 

points.



DATES: The final rule becomes effective on October 23, 2009.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Background



    The FDIC adopted the TLGP in October 2008 following a determination 

of systemic risk by the Secretary of the Treasury (after consultation 

with the President) that was supported by recommendations from the FDIC 

and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal 

Reserve).\1\ The TLGP is part of a coordinated effort by the FDIC, the 

U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and the Federal Reserve to 

address unprecedented disruptions in the credit markets and the 

resultant difficulty of many financial institutions to obtain funds and 

to make loans to creditworthy borrowers. On October 23, 2008, the 

FDIC's Board of Directors (Board) authorized the publication in the 

Federal Register of an interim rule that outlined the structure of the 

TLGP.\2\ Designed to assist in the stabilization of the nation's 

financial system, the FDIC's TLGP is composed of two distinct 

components: The DGP and the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAG 

program). Under the DGP, the FDIC guarantees certain senior unsecured 

debt issued by participating entities. Under the TAG program, the FDIC 

guarantees all funds held in qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction 

accounts at participating insured depository institutions (IDIs).\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



    \1\ See Section 13(c)(4)(G) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 

(FDI Act), 12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)(G). The determination of systemic 

risk triggered the FDIC's authority--``in its sole discretion and 

upon such terms and conditions as the [FDIC's] Board of Directors 

may prescribe--to take actions to avoid or mitigate serious adverse 

effects on economic conditions or financial stability.'' See also 

Section 9(a) Tenth of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1819(a)Tenth. The FDIC 

implemented the TLGP in response.

    \2\ 73 FR 64179 (October 29, 2008). This interim rule was 

finalized and a final rule was published in the Federal Register on 

November 26, 2008. 73 FR 72244 (November 26, 2008).

    \3\ On June 23, 2009, the Board proposed two alternatives for 

phasing out the TAG. The first alternative provided that the TAG 

would expire on December 31, 2009, as required by the terms of the 

existing rule. The second alternative provided for a limited six-

month extension to that program. Following consideration of the 

comments submitted in response to the two alternatives, on August 

26, 2009, the Board adopted and approved for publication in the 

Federal Register a final rule providing for a six-month extension of 

the TAG program, through June 30, 2010. See 74 FR 45093 (September 

1, 2009).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



    The DGP initially permitted participating entities to issue FDIC-

guaranteed senior unsecured debt until June 30, 2009, with the FDIC's 

guarantee for such debt to expire on the earlier of the maturity of the 

debt (or the conversion date, for mandatory convertible debt) or June 

30, 2012.

    To reduce the potential for market disruptions at the conclusion of 

the DGP and to begin the orderly phase-out of the program, on May 29, 

2009 the Board issued a final rule that extended for four months the 

period during which certain participating entities could issue FDIC-

guaranteed debt.\4\ All IDIs and those other participating entities 

that had issued FDIC-guaranteed debt on or before April 1, 2009 were 

permitted to participate in the extended DGP without application to the 

FDIC. Other participating entities that received approval from the FDIC 

also were permitted to participate in the extended DGP. The expiration 

of the guarantee period was also extended from June 30, 2012 to 

December 31, 2012. As a result, all such participating entities were 

permitted to issue FDIC-guaranteed debt through and including October 

31, 2009, with the FDIC's guarantee expiring on the earliest of the 

debt's mandatory conversion date (for mandatory convertible debt), the 

stated maturity date, or December 31, 2012.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



    \4\ 74 FR 26521 (June 3, 2009).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



    With over $600 billion in guaranteed debt having been issued by 118 

entities, the TLGP has been an important factor in restoring liquidity 

and confidence in the banking system. The program enabled banking 

organizations to meet financing needs at affordable terms during a 

period of system-wide turmoil. Recently, credit and liquidity 

conditions have become less stressed. Narrowing



[[Page 54744]]



spreads on both TLGP debt and non-guaranteed debt indicate that access 

to funding has improved. Only a few entities have issued TLGP debt 

during the extended DGP period, and recently several banking 

organizations have successfully issued non-guaranteed debt. The total 

amount of FDIC-guaranteed debt outstanding as of October 1, 2009 under 

the TLGP is $300 billion.

    Noting the evidence that the domestic credit and liquidity markets 

are beginning to normalize, on September 9, 2009, the Board authorized 

publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposed two 

alternatives for concluding the DGP.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



    \5\ 74 FR 47489 (September 16, 2009).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



II. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking



    The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Proposed Rule) presented two 

alternatives for concluding the FDIC's guarantee of senior unsecured 

debt under the DGP, Alternative A and Alternative B.



A. Alternative A



    Alternative A would have preserved the expiration dates for the 

issuance periods and for the duration of the guarantees under the DGP. 

Thus, all IDIs participating in the DGP and other participating 

entities that had either (i) issued guaranteed debt before April 1, 

2009, or (ii) had not issued guaranteed debt before April 1, 2009, but 

had received the FDIC's permission to issue guaranteed debt through 

October 31, 2009 would be permitted to issue FDIC-guaranteed senior 

unsecured debt through October 31, 2009. The FDIC's guarantee for such 

debt issuances would expire no later than December 31, 2012.



B. Alternative B



    Like Alternative A, Alternative B provided that the basic DGP would 

expire as structured under the existing regulation. However, 

Alternative B also proposed the establishment of a limited, six-month 

emergency guarantee facility upon expiration of the DGP on October 31, 

2009.

    The emergency guarantee facility under Alternative B was intended 

to address a participating entity's inability to replace maturing 

senior unsecured debt with non-guaranteed debt as a result of market 

disruptions or other circumstances beyond the control of the 

participating entity. Under this emergency guarantee facility, certain 

participating entities could apply to the FDIC for permission to issue 

FDIC-guaranteed debt after October 31, 2009. If the FDIC approved an 

entity's request, the FDIC would guarantee the entity's senior 

unsecured debt issued after October 31, 2009, through and including 

April 30, 2010. Any such approval would be subject to such restrictions 

and conditions as the FDIC deemed appropriate including, but not 

limited to, a pledge of collateral, and limitations on executive 

compensation, bonuses, or the payment of dividends. Under Alternative 

B, the FDIC would assess a fee using an annualized assessment rate 

equal to at least 300 basis points on any FDIC-guaranteed debt issued 

by entities under the emergency guarantee facility. The FDIC would 

reserve the right to increase the assessment rate on a case-by-case 

basis, depending upon the risks presented by the issuing entity. The 

FDIC's guarantee of principal and interest payments for senior 

unsecured debt issuances approved under the emergency guarantee 

facility would extend through the earliest of the mandatory conversion 

date (for mandatory convertible debt), the stated maturity date, or 

December 31, 2012. Under Alternative B, all of the terms and provisions 

of the FDIC's guarantee under the DGP would apply to such debt except 

as amended by the final rule. Further, under Alternative B, there would 

be no effect on any conditions that the FDIC may have placed on the 

issuance of debt by an IDI or other entity participating in the DGP. 

Any IDI participating in the DGP and any other entity participating in 

the DGP that has issued FDIC-guaranteed debt by September 9, 2009, 

would be permitted to apply to use this emergency guarantee facility.



III. Summary of Comments Received



    The FDIC requested comments on all aspects of the Proposed Rule. 

The FDIC specifically requested that commenters indicate a preference 

for either Alternative A or Alternative B. The FDIC also sought 

comments on whether, under Alternative B, eligibility for the emergency 

guarantee facility should be limited to participating IDIs and to those 

other entities that had issued FDIC-guaranteed debt on or before 

September 9, 2009. In response to the request, the FDIC received four 

(4) comments from the following: One comment (1) from an individual; 

one comment (1) from an industry association; and two comments (2) from 

two separate groups of LL.M. candidates at a law school. A summary of 

the comments the FDIC received follows.

    The individual commenter expressed the belief that the DGP provides 

a valuable service and, therefore, should not be concluded as currently 

structured. The commenter noted that the DGP has value as a support 

mechanism regardless of whether it is under-utilized.

    A banking industry association commented in support of Alternative 

B as the most appropriate phase-out of the DGP. Specifically, the 

association expressed support for allowing access to the emergency 

guarantee facility on a limited case-by-case basis for emergency 

circumstances. The association also noted that domestic credit and 

liquidity markets have begun to normalize and the number of entities 

issuing debt under the DGP has decreased. The association expressed the 

opinion that access to the emergency guarantee facility should be 

limited to IDIs or other entities that have issued FDIC-guaranteed 

senior unsecured debt on or before September 9, 2009. The association 

also supported a robust participation fee and noted that such a fee 

could both encourage a winding down of the DGP and generate increased 

TLGP revenue.

    The FDIC also received comment letters from two groups of law 

students. Both groups supported the adoption of Alternative B as the 

most appropriate phase-out of the DGP, and both also requested that any 

final rule provide the FDIC with the discretion to decrease the 

proposed 300 basis points assessment rate.

    The FDIC is establishing the emergency guarantee facility to serve 

as a mechanism to phase-out the DGP, it is not intended to encourage 

indefinite participation. The FDIC believes that establishing a 300 

basis point minimum assessment rate will provide a more effective 

incentive for participating entities to wean themselves off of the 

FDIC's guarantee program. Consequently, the FDIC has decided to retain 

the 300 basis point minimum assessment rate.

    Regarding access to the emergency guarantee facility, one student 

group supported restricting access to the emergency guarantee facility 

as proposed in Alternative B, noting that such a restriction would both 

provide an adequate safeguard against dependency and ensure that the 

facility is available only in severe circumstances. The second student 

group recommended that the FDIC expand the emergency guarantee facility 

eligibility to all financial institutions originally eligible under the 

DGP. This group asserted that expanding eligibility would protect the 

DIF, perpetuate the objectives of the TLGP, help deserving 

nonparticipating institutions avoid receivership, grant the FDIC 

greater discretion, and result in minimal additional costs to the FDIC.



[[Page 54745]]



    As noted above, the FDIC is establishing the emergency guarantee 

facility to phase-out the DGP in an orderly manner. Expanding access to 

all entities originally eligible would be inconsistent with that goal. 

As a result, the FDIC believes that limiting the eligibility as 

provided in Alternative B is the more appropriate way to achieve the 

goal of the emergency guarantee facility.

    The two student groups also expressed a number of additional 

concerns regarding the proposed Alternative B. One group recommended 

that a final rule adopting Alternative B should include mandatory end-

use restrictions, such as limitations on executive compensation. This 

group also recommended that the application requirements for access to 

the emergency guarantee facility include a statement identifying any 

changes from all prior plans for the retirement of FDIC-guaranteed debt 

that an applicant had submitted to the FDIC under the DGP. Moreover, 

this group recommended requiring that applications for the emergency 

guarantee facility include a business plan that states clear objectives 

for avoiding use of the emergency guarantee facility in the future. The 

second group expressed concern that Alternative B includes overly-broad 

language when describing the types of situations that would warrant 

granting access to the emergency guarantee facility. The group 

recommended that the FDIC provide clearer guidelines and principles 

outlining the kind of financial challenges that can be construed as 

stemming from market disruption. The group also recommended that the 

FDIC provide greater guidance on how participation in the emergency 

guarantee facility would impact the participant's disclosures, raising 

the question of whether an applicant that has been denied access to the 

emergency guarantee facility must disclose the fact that it has been 

denied such access.

    The FDIC believes that the emergency guarantee facility as designed 

can adequately address the concerns underlying these suggestions. In 

order to be effective, the emergency guarantee facility must be 

available to handle a variety of adverse circumstances, including some 

that have not yet been encountered or even forseen. Providing too 

narrow a description of the circumstances when the facility would be 

available could limit its effectiveness. The FDIC also believes that 

imposing too many mandatory requirements could also be 

counterproductive. The FDIC needs flexibility in responding to these 

situations. Since the FDIC can impose any condition it deems 

appropriate and can, of course, decide not to approve an entity's use 

of the emergency guarantee facility, the FDIC believes that it has the 

ability to address these concerns and the flexibility to effectively 

respond to unforeseen circumstances.



IV. The Final Rule



    The FDIC is adopting the proposal described in Alternative B as a 

final rule. As discussed below, the final rule will allow the basic DGP 

to expire on October 31, 2009 as currently structured. However, the 

final rule will also establish a limited six-month emergency guarantee 

facility upon the expiration of the basic DGP. The FDIC believes this 

approach provides the most appropriate phase-out of the basic DGP.



A. Expiration of Debt Guarantee Program



    Under the final rule, the DGP will expire as currently structured 

under existing regulation. Thus, all IDI's participating in the DGP and 

other participating entities that had either (i) issued guaranteed debt 

before April 1, 2009, or (ii) had not issued guaranteed debt before 

April 1, 2009, but had received FDIC's permission to issue guaranteed 

debt through October 31, 2009, are permitted to issue FDIC-guaranteed 

senior unsecured debt through October 31, 2009. The FDIC's guarantee 

for such debt issuances will expire no later than December 31, 2012.



B. Emergency Guarantee Facility



    Additionally, the final rule establishes a limited six-month 

emergency guarantee facility upon the expiration of the basic DGP. The 

emergency guarantee facility addresses an entity's inability to replace 

maturing senior unsecured debt with non-guaranteed debt as a result of 

market disruptions or other circumstances beyond the control of the 

participating entity. Under the final rule, the FDIC will guarantee 

senior unsecured debt issued after October 31, 2009, subject to the 

FDIC's prior approval on a case-by-case basis, through April 30, 2010 

by certain entities participating in the DGP; such guarantee will be 

subject to such restrictions and conditions that the FDIC deems 

appropriate. The duration of the FDIC's guarantee of senior unsecured 

debt issuances approved under the emergency guarantee facility will 

extend through the earliest of the mandatory conversion date (for 

mandatory convertible debt), the stated maturity date, or December 31, 

2012. All of the terms and provisions of the DGP that are not amended 

by this final rule will apply to such debt issuances. The final rule 

does not affect any conditions that the FDIC has placed on the issuance 

of debt by an IDI or other entity participating in the DGP.

    Any IDI participating in the DGP and any other entity participating 

in the DGP that has issued FDIC-guaranteed debt by September 9, 2009, 

is permitted to apply to use the emergency guarantee facility.

i. Application Requirements for Participation in the Emergency 

Guarantee Facility

    The final rule requires prior approval by the FDIC before an entity 

may participate in the emergency guarantee facility. Applications to 

participate in the emergency guarantee facility must be submitted to 

the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection on 

or before April 30, 2010. FDIC prior approval to participate in the 

emergency guarantee facility will be granted on a case-by-case basis 

subject to such terms and conditions as the FDIC deems appropriate.

    Under the final rule, participation in the emergency guarantee 

facility is limited. Only those eligible entities that demonstrate an 

inability to issue non-guaranteed debt to replace maturing senior 

unsecured debt as a result of market disruptions or other circumstances 

beyond the entity's control may apply. The final rule requires that 

applications to participate in the emergency guarantee facility include 

the following: A projection of the sources and uses of funds through 

December 31, 2012; a summary of the entity's contingency plans; a 

description of any collateral that the entity can make available to 

secure the entity's obligation to reimburse the FDIC for any payments 

made pursuant to the guarantee; a description of the plans for 

retirement of the FDIC-guaranteed debt; a description of the market 

disruptions or other circumstances beyond the entity's control that 

prevent the entity from replacing maturing debt with non-guaranteed 

debt; a description of management's efforts to mitigate the effects of 

such disruptions or circumstances; conclusive evidence that 

demonstrates the entity's inability to issue non-guaranteed debt; and 

any other relevant information that the FDIC deems appropriate.

ii. Participation Fee

    Under the final rule, the FDIC will assess a fee equal to the 

amount of the debt to be guaranteed times the number of years (or 

portions thereof) from



[[Page 54746]]



issuance date through the earliest of the mandatory conversion date 

(for mandatory convertible debt), the stated maturity date, or December 

31, 2012 times an assessment rate of at least 300 basis points on any 

guaranteed debt issued under the emergency guarantee facility. The FDIC 

reserves the right to increase the fee on a case-by-case basis, 

depending upon the risks presented by the issuing entity. The FDIC 

believes that the fee established under the final rule will provide an 

appropriate deterrent to applications based on other, less severe 

circumstances or concerns. Under the final rule, a participating entity 

may be required to pledge sufficient collateral to ensure the repayment 

of any principal and interest payments made by the FDIC under the 

emergency guarantee facility, subject to any other conditions and 

restrictions that the FDIC deems appropriate. Such conditions and 

restrictions may include, for example, limiting executive 

compensations, bonuses, or the payment of dividends.



V. Regulatory Analysis and Procedure



A. Administrative Procedure Act



    The process of amending Part 370 by means of this final rule is 

governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Section 553(d)(3) 

of the APA provides that the publication of a rule shall be made not 

less than 30 days before its effective date, except ``as otherwise 

provided by the agency for good cause found and published with the 

rule.'' \6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



    \6\ 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



    When it issued the interim rule and the final rule initially 

implementing the TLGP, the FDIC invoked this good cause exception based 

on the severe financial conditions that threatened the stability of the 

nation's economy generally and the banking system in particular.\7\ 

Recently, credit and liquidity conditions have become less stressed. 

Narrowing spreads on both TLGP debt and non-guaranteed debt indicate 

that access to funding has improved. Only a few entities have issued 

TLGP debt during the extended DGP period, and recently several banking 

organizations have successfully issued non-guaranteed debt. In order to 

continue the orderly phase out of the basic DGP and to ensure that the 

creation of the emergency guarantee facility occurs at the conclusion 

of the basic DGP on October 31, 2009, the FDIC finds that good cause 

exists for an immediate effective date for the final rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



    \7\ See 74 FR 26521 (June 3, 2009) and 73 FR 72244 (Nov. 26, 

2008).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



B. Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act



    The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act 

(RCDRIA) provides that any new regulations or amendments to regulations 

prescribed by a Federal banking agency that impose additional 

reporting, disclosures, or other new requirements on IDIs shall take 

effect on the first day of a calendar quarter which begins on or after 

the date on which the regulations are published in final form, unless 

the agency determines, for good cause published with the rule, that the 

rule should become effective before such time.\8\ For the same reasons 

as discussed above, the FDIC finds that good cause exists for an 

immediate effective date for the final rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



    \8\ 12 U.S.C. 4802.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



C. Small Business Regulator Enforcement Fairness Act



    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determined that this 

final rule is not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of the relevant 

sections of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act of 1996 

(SBREFA), 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq. As required by SBREFA, the FDIC will 

file appropriate reports with Congress and the Government 

Accountability Office.



D. Regulatory Flexibility Act



    Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the FDIC must prepare a 

final regulatory flexibility analysis in connection with the 

promulgation of a final rule,\9\ or certify that the final rule will 

not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 

entities.\10\ For purposes of the RFA analysis or certification, 

financial institutions with total assets of $175 million or less are 

considered to be ``small entities.'' For reasons discussed below, the 

FDIC certifies that the final rule will not have a significant economic 

impact on a substantial number of small entities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



    \9\ 5 U.S.C. 604.

    \10\ 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



    Currently, 4,394 IDIs participate in the DGP, of which 

approximately 2,120 (or approximately 48 percent) are small entities. 

Under the final rule, all 2,120 IDIs that would be considered small 

entities for purposes of this analysis are eligible to apply to access 

the emergency guarantee facility. As a result, the FDIC asserts that 

the final rule may affect a substantial number of IDIs that are small 

entities that participate in the DGP.

    Nevertheless, the FDIC has determined that the final rule's 

economic impact on small entities will not be significant for the 

following reasons. The emergency guarantee facility is designed to be 

accessed on an emergency case-by-case basis by IDIs (and other entities 

that issued debt under the DGP) only if such entities are unable to 

replace maturing debt as a result of market disruptions or other 

circumstances beyond the entities' control. Eighty-one IDIs have issued 

FDIC-guaranteed debt through the DGP since the program's inception. It 

is unlikely that a significant number of IDIs (or other qualifying 

entities) would satisfy the requirements to issue FDIC-guaranteed debt 

during such emergency circumstances. Accordingly, the final rule will 

not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 

entities.



E. Paperwork Reduction Act



    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 

3501 et seq.), an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is 

not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it 

displays a currently valid OMB control number. This Final Rule 

implements Alternative B of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which 

establishes an emergency guarantee facility to ensure an orderly phase-

out of the debt guarantee component of the Temporary Liquidity 

Guarantee Program. Alternative B includes, in section 370.3(h)(viii), 

an application requirement for IDIs and non-IDIs wishing to access the 

emergency guarantee facility. In conjunction with publication of the 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the FDIC submitted to OMB a request for 

clearance of the paperwork burden associated with the application 

requirement in Alternative B. That request is still pending.

    The proposed rule document requested comment on the estimated 

paperwork burden. However, none of the comments received addressed the 

estimated paperwork burden. Therefore, the FDIC has not altered its 

initial burden estimates. The estimated burden for the application 

requirement, as set forth in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and 

Final Rule, is as follows:

    Title: ``Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program--Emergency Guarantee 

Facility.''

    OMB Number: 3064--NEW.

    Estimated Number of Respondents: Application to access emergency 

guarantee facility submitted by IDIs--8.

    Application to access emergency guarantee facility submitted by 

non-IDIs that issued FDIC-guaranteed debt under the DGP--4.



[[Page 54747]]



    Frequency of Response: Application to access emergency guarantee 

facility submitted by IDIs--once.

    Application to access emergency guarantee facility submitted by 

non-IDIs that issued FDIC-guaranteed debt under the DGP--once.

    Affected Public: IDIs; thrift holding companies, bank and financial 

holding companies, and affiliates of IDIs that issued debt under the 

DGP.

    Average Time per Response: Application to access emergency 

guarantee facility submitted by IDIs--4 hours.

    Application to access emergency guarantee facility submitted by 

non-IDIs that issued FDIC-guaranteed debt under the DGP--4 hours.

    Estimated Annual Burden: Application to access emergency guarantee 

facility submitted by IDIs--32 hours.

    Application to access emergency guarantee facility submitted by 

non-IDIs that issued FDIC-guaranteed debt under the DGP--16 hours.

    Total Annual Burden--48 hours.

    Comment Request: The FDIC has an ongoing interest in public 

comments on its collections of information, including comments on: (1) 

Whether this collection of information is necessary for the proper 

performance of the FDIC's functions, including whether the information 

has practical utility; (2) the accuracy of the estimates of the burden 

of the information collection, including the validity of the 

methodologies and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, 

utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways 

to minimize the burden of the information collection on respondents, 

including through the use of automated collection techniques or other 

forms of information technology. Comments may be submitted to the FDIC 

by any of the following methods:

F. Solicitation of Comments on Use of Plain Language



    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Public Law 106-102, 113 

Stat. 1338, 1471 (Nov. 12, 1999), requires the federal banking agencies 

to use plain language in all proposed and final rules published after 

January 1, 2000. In issuing the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking the FDIC 

requested comment on how to make the regulation easier to understand. 

The FDIC received one comment in response to the request. The comment 

supported the FDIC's use of plain language in the NPR.



G. The Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999--

Assessment of Federal Regulations and Policies on Families



    The FDIC has determined that the Final Rule will not affect family 

well-being within the measure of section 654 of the Treasury and 

General Government Appropriations Act, enacted as part of the Omnibus 

Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 

(Pub. L. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681).
