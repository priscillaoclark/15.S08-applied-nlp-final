Electronic Payment and Refund of Quarterly Harbor Maintenance 
Fees

AGENCIES: Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland 
Security; Department of the Treasury.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document proposes to amend title 19 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations by prescribing alternative procedures by which 
payers of the quarterly harbor maintenance fee (HMF) may submit their 
payments or refund requests to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
electronically via an Internet account established by the payer and 
located at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.pay.gov">http://www.pay.gov</A>. CBP will continue to accept quarterly 
HMF payments or refund requests via mail. It is also proposed to 
clarify the regulations to state that each HMF quarterly payment, 
whether paper or electronic, must be accompanied by a CBP Form 349 (HMF 
Quarterly Summary Report). The changes proposed in this document are 
intended to provide the trade with expanded electronic payment/refund 
options for quarterly HMFs and to modernize and enhance CBP's port use 
fee collection efforts.

Background

Harbor Maintenance Fee (HMF)

    The harbor maintenance fee (HMF) was created by the Water Resources 
Development Act of 1986 (Pub. L.99-622, 26 U.S.C. 4461 et seq.). The 
purpose of the fee is to require those who benefit from the maintenance 
of U.S. ports and harbors to share in the associated costs of such 
maintenance. The HMF is assessed based on 0.125 percent of the value of 
commercial cargo loaded or unloaded at certain identified ports or, in 
the case of passengers, on the value of the actual charge paid for the 
transportation.

Existing HMF Regulations

    The HMF implementing regulations are set forth in Sec.  24.24 of 
title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 24.24). Section 
24.24(e) sets forth the procedures applicable to HMF collections, 
supplemental payments, and refunds. Generally, this provision requires 
accumulated HMFs to be paid on a quarterly basis by mailing a check or 
money order to a specified CBP address, accompanied by a CBP Form 349 
(HMF Quarterly Summary Report). See 19 CFR 24.24(e)(1)(ii), (2)(iii), 
and (3)(ii). A supplemental HMF payment or refund request must be 
accompanied by a CBP Form 350 (HMF Amended Quarterly Summary Report), 
along with a copy of the CBP Form 349. See 19 CFR 24.24(e)(4)(i) and 
(iii). Section 24.24(f) provides that all quarterly payments required 
by this section be received no later than 31 days after the close of 
the quarter being paid.

Proposed Amendments to the HMF Regulations

    Most of the changes proposed in this document affect 19 CFR 
24.24(e) which, as noted above, sets forth the procedures applicable to 
HMF payments and refunds. Specifically, this document proposes new 
alternative procedures that would permit the electronic payment of 
quarterly HMFs using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet 
account established by the payer and located at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.pay.gov">http://www.pay.gov</A>. 
Requests for HMF refunds may also be made through <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.pay.gov">http://www.pay.gov</A>. 
Approved HMF refund payments will be made via ACH to those payers who 
are enrolled in the ACH refund program; all others will receive refund 
payments via mail. As these proposed electronic procedures are 
voluntary, CBP will continue to accept HMF payments and refund requests 
sent via mail.
    Pay.gov is a secure Internet payment platform provided by the 
Financial Management Service (FMS) for payments to federal agencies. 
CBP has migrated payment of certain fees and taxes to the pay.gov 
platform through the use of ACH debit transactions. CBP will distribute 
a user-guide to HMF payers that provides information regarding account 
set-up and related issues.
    This document also proposes to clarify 19 CFR 24.24(e) to require 
that, for both paper and electronic payments of the quarterly HMF, a 
CBP Form 349 must accompany each HMF payment. All three provisions of 
the existing HMF payment regulations set forth at 19 CFR 
24.24(e)(1)(ii), (2)(iii), and (3)(ii) require the payer to pay all 
fees for which he is liable for the quarter by mailing a check or money 
order payable to CBP and a Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary 
Report, Customs Form 349. Based on the existing terms of these 
provisions, a payer is required to remit a single quarterly payment to 
CBP accompanied by a single CBP Form 349. In practice, however, CBP has 
received HMF payments by methods that do not follow the regulations. 
For example, CBP has received several HMF payments from a single payer 
for a quarter or, in the alternative, a single HMF payment that is 
accompanied by several CBP Form 349s. In a purely paper environment, 
CBP was able to process these submissions. In the context of an 
electronic paperless environment, however, it is proposed to require 
that a single CBP Form be submitted with each HMF payment to support 
the transactional requirements of <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.pay.gov">http://www.pay.gov</A> and to promote 
consistency and harmonization of HMF collection procedures.
    These proposed changes, other than those involving non-substantive 
editorial changes, are discussed below in more detail.

Explanation of Amendments

    It is proposed to amend 19 CFR 24.24 to set forth alternative 
expanded procedures for the electronic payment and refund of quarterly 
HMFs. It is also proposed to amend this section to require that each 
HMF quarterly payment or refund request, whether paper or electronic, 
be accompanied by a CBP Form 349 or 350, as appropriate.

Section 24.24(c)(8)(i)

    Section 24.24(c) describes the types of commercial cargo that are 
exempt from the HMF. Within this provision, paragraph (c)(8)(i) 
specifies donated cargo that is certified by CBP as intended for use in 
humanitarian or development assistance overseas, including contiguous 
countries, as exempt from the HMF. The existing regulations direct that 
a request for a refund made pursuant to this provision should be made 
on a CBP Form 350 and sent to the Office of Finance located at CBP 
Headquarters in Washington, DC, along with a CBP Form 349 for each 
quarter for which a refund is requested and supporting evidence that 
establishes that the entity donating the cargo is a nonprofit 
organization or cooperative and that the cargo was intended for 
humanitarian or development assistance overseas.
    It is proposed to amend this provision to clarify that HMF refund 
requests must be submitted to CBP on a Harbor Maintenance Fee Amended 
Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 350, and to provide that the form 
may either be mailed to the Office of Finance, Revenue Division, 
Customs and Border Protection, 6650 Telecom Drive, Indianapolis, 
Indiana 46278, or it may be submitted electronically to CBP via an 
Internet account established by the payer and located at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.pay.gov">http://
www.pay.gov</A>. Upon request by CBP, the party requesting the refund must 
also submit to CBP, via mail, the Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly 
Summary Report, CBP Form 349, for the quarter covering the payment to 
which the refund request relates as well as any supporting 
documentation deemed necessary by CBP to certify that the entity 
donating the cargo is a nonprofit organization or cooperative and that 
the cargo was intended for humanitarian or development assistance 
overseas (including contiguous countries). Approved HMF refund payments 
will

[[Page 45366]]

be made via ACH to those payers who are enrolled in the ACH refund 
program; all others will receive HMF refund payments via mail.

Section 24.24(e)

    Section 24.24(e) sets forth the procedures applicable to HMF 
collections, supplemental payments and refunds. Section 24.24(e)(1)(ii) 
prescribes the method by which the shipper whose name appears on the 
Vessel Operation Report must pay the HMF for domestic vessel movements. 
Specifically, this provision directs that the shipper pay the 
accumulated fees on a quarterly basis by mailing a check or money order 
to CBP along with the CBP Form 349.
    It is proposed to amend this provision to state that the shipper 
may submit the quarterly HMF payments to CBP either electronically 
using ACH via an Internet account established by the payer and located 
at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.pay.gov">http://www.pay.gov</A> or by check or money order to the address 
specified therein. It is also proposed to clarify this provision to 
state that each HMF quarterly payment, whether paper or electronic, 
must be accompanied by a CBP Form 349.
    Several other provisions within Sec.  24.24(e) currently require 
the payer to submit HMF payments or refund requests on a quarterly 
basis by mailing a check or money order to CBP along with the CBP Form 
349 or 350, as applicable.
    In Sec. Sec.  24.24(e)(2)(iii), 24.24(e)(3)(ii), and 
24.24(e)(4)(iii), it is proposed to make changes similar to those 
described above to reflect that a payer may submit quarterly HMF 
payments to CBP either electronically using ACH via an Internet account 
established by the payer and located at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.pay.gov">http://www.pay.gov</A> or by check 
or money order to the address specified therein and that each HMF 
payment, whether paper or electronic, must be accompanied by a CBP Form 
349. Similarly, it is proposed that each HMF refund request must be 
submitted on a CBP Form 350 and may either be submitted to CBP 
electronically via an Internet account established by the payer and 
located at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.pay.gov">http://www.pay.gov</A> or via mail. Upon request by CBP, the 
party requesting the refund must submit to CBP, via mail, the CBP Form 
349 for the quarter covering the payment to which the refund request 
relates as well as any supporting documentation deemed necessary by 
CBP. Approved HMF refund payments will be made via ACH to those payers 
who are enrolled in the ACH refund program; all others will receive HMF 
refund payments via mail.
    Section 24.24(e)(4)(iv)(B)(4) provides that a protest may be filed 
for any payment not approved for a refund in a Revised Report/
Certification within 90 days of the issuance of that report. As the 
Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2004 (Pub. L.108-
429, 118 Stat. 2593) extended the time to file and amend a protest from 
90 days to 180 days, it is proposed to amend this provision 
accordingly.

Section 24.24(g)

    Section 24.24(g) sets forth the recordkeeping requirements 
applicable to this section. This provision directs the parties 
responsible for the maintenance of records to provide certain contact 
information to the Director, Accounting Services in Accounts 
Receivable. It is proposed to amend this provision to reflect that this 
information be provided to the Director, Revenue Division.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866

    Because these proposed amendments implement alternative procedures 
that provide expanded electronic payment/refund options for quarterly 
HMFs and do not require small entities to change their business 
practices, pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., it is certified that, if adopted, the 
proposed amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. Further, these proposed 
amendments do not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory 
action'' as specified in E.O. 12866.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information in the current regulations have 
already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 
accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507) 
and assigned OMB control number 1651-0055 (harbor maintenance fee). 
This rule does not involve any material change to the existing approved 
information collection. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless the collection of information displays a valid control number 
assigned by OMB.

Signing Authority

    This document is being issued in accordance with 19 CFR 0.1(a)(1).

List of Subjects in 19 CFR Part 24

    Accounting, Claims, Customs duties and inspection, Exports, 
Imports, Interest, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Taxes, 
User fees, Wages.

Amendments to the Regulations

    For the reasons set forth in the preamble, part 24 of title 19 of 
the CFR (19 CFR part 24) is proposed to be amended as set forth below.
