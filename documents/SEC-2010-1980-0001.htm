Mine Safety Disclosure

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Proposed rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: We are proposing amendments to our rules to implement Section 
1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 
Section 1503(a) of the Act requires issuers that are operators, or that 
have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine to 
disclose in their periodic reports filed with the Commission 
information regarding specified health and safety violations, orders 
and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-
related fatalities. Section 1503(b) of the Act mandates the filing of a 
Form 8-K disclosing the receipt of certain orders and notices from the 
Mine Safety and Health Administration.

I. Background and Summary

    Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act (the ``Act'') \11\ requires issuers that are required to 
file reports with the Commission pursuant to sections 13(a) or 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act and that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that 
is an operator, of a coal or other mine to disclose specified 
information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports 
filed with the Commission.\12\ Section 1503(b) of the Act requires each 
issuer that is an operator, or that has a subsidiary that is an 
operator, of a coal or other mine to file a current report on Form 8-K 
with the Commission reporting receipt of certain shutdown orders and 
notices of patterns or potential patterns of violations.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ Pub. L. 111-203 (July 21, 2010).
    \12\ Section 1503(a) of the Act.
    \13\ Section 1503(b) of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The disclosure requirements set forth in Section 1503 of the Act 
refer to and are based on the safety and health requirements applicable 
to mines under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the 
``Mine Act''),\14\ which is administered by the U.S. Labor Department's 
Mine Safety and Health Administration (``MSHA''). Under the Mine Act, 
MSHA is required to inspect surface mines at least twice a year and 
underground mines at least four times a year \15\ to determine whether 
there is compliance with health and safety standards or with any 
citation, order or decision issued under the Mine Act and whether an 
imminent danger exists. MSHA also conducts spot inspections \16\ and 
inspections pursuant to miners' complaints.\17\ If violations of safety 
or health standards are found, MSHA inspectors will issue citations to 
the mine operators. Among other activities under the Mine Act, MSHA 
also assesses and collects civil monetary penalties for violations of 
mine safety and health standards.\18\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    MSHA maintains a data retrieval system on its Web site that allows 
users to examine data on inspections, violations, and accidents, as 
well as information about dust samplings, at specific mines throughout 
the United States.\19\ The information provided by the MSHA data 
retrieval system is based on data gathered from various MSHA systems. 
For example, when citations, orders or violations are issued by MSHA to 
mine operators, the information about such citations, orders or 
violations is entered by MSHA into MSHA's systems and subsequently 
reflected in the data retrieval system within a short period of time. 
The data retrieval system allows a user to search for information based 
on the identification numbers assigned to specific mines or contractors 
(MSHA Mine ID or Contractor ID), as well as by operator name, mine 
name, contractor name or controller name.\20\ In all cases, the 
information is displayed in the data retrieval system on a mine-by-mine 
basis.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ See <a href="http://www.msha.gov/DRS/DRSHOME.HTM">http://www.msha.gov/DRS/DRSHOME.HTM</a>.
    \20\ The controller is the company or individual that MSHA's 
Office of Assessments has determined to have ultimate control or 
ownership of the operator.
    \21\ When the disclosure requirements of Section 1503 of the Act 
were introduced, Senator Rockefeller noted his concern that ``there 
is no requirement to publicly disclose safety records'' of mining 
companies. See SA 3886 (an amendment to SA 3739 to S. 3217, 111th 
Cong. (May 6, 2010); Press Release: Rockefeller Requires Mining 
Companies to Disclose Safety Records, May 7, 2010, available at 
<a href="http://rockefeller.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=324768&">http://rockefeller.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=324768&</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, an independent adjudicative agency, the Federal Mine 
Safety and Health Review Commission (the ``FMSHRC''), provides 
administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising 
under the Mine Act.\22\ Most cases deal with civil penalties proposed 
by MSHA to be assessed against mine operators and address whether the 
alleged safety and health violations occurred, as well as the 
appropriateness of proposed penalties.\23\ The FMSHRC's administrative 
law judges decide cases at the trial level and the five-member FMSHRC 
provides appellate review. Appeals from the FMSHRC's decisions are to 
the U.S. courts of appeals.\24\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The disclosure requirements set forth in the Act are currently in 
effect.\25\ However, the Act states that the Commission is ``authorized 
to issue such rules or regulations as are necessary or appropriate for 
the protection of investors and to carry out the purposes of [Section 
1503].'' \26\ Accordingly, we are proposing to amend our rules to 
implement and specify the scope and application of the disclosure 
requirements set forth in the Act and to require a limited amount of 
additional disclosure to provide context for certain items required by 
the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ See Section 1503(f) of the Act.
    \26\ Section 1503(d)(2) of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Specifically, we are proposing amendments to Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, 
Form 20-F and Form 40-F to require the disclosure required by Section 
1503(a) of the Act and certain additional disclosures. The disclosure 
requirements for Forms 10-Q and 10-K would be set forth in new Item 106 
of Regulation S-K. Because the information required to be disclosed 
under proposed Item 106 of Regulation S-K would be set forth in an 
exhibit to the filing, we are proposing to amend Item 601 of Regulation 
S-K to add a new exhibit to Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We are proposing 
to amend Forms 20-F and 40-F to include the same disclosure 
requirements as those proposed for issuers that are not foreign private 
issuers. In addition, we are proposing to add a new item to Form 8-K to 
implement the requirement imposed by Section 1503(b) of the Act, and to 
amend Form S-3 to add the new Form 8-K item to the list of Form 8-K 
items the untimely filing of which will not result in loss of Form S-3 
eligibility.

II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendments

A. Required Disclosure in Periodic Reports

    As noted above, the requirements in Section 1503(a) are already in 
effect. We are proposing to codify the requirements into our disclosure 
rules in order to facilitate consistent compliance with them by 
reporting companies.
    In order to implement the disclosure requirement set forth in 
Section 1503(a) of the Act, we are proposing to add new Item 4 to Part 
II of Form 10-Q and new Item 4(b) to Part I of Form 10-K, which would 
require the information required by new Items 106 and 601(b)(95) of 
Regulation S-K; new Item 16J to Form 20-F; and new Paragraph (18) of 
General Instruction B of Form 40-F. These proposed items would be 
identical in substance and entitled, ``Mine Safety Disclosure.'' As 
discussed in detail below, the proposed items would require issuers to 
provide in their periodic reports and in exhibits to their periodic 
reports the information listed in Section 1503(a) of the Act and 
certain

[[Page 80376]]

additional disclosure designed to provide context for such information.
1. Scope
    Section 1503(a) of the Act mandates that specified disclosure be 
provided in each periodic report filed with the Commission by every 
issuer that is required to file reports with the Commission pursuant to 
sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and that is ``an operator, 
or that has a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other 
mine.'' The Act specifies that the term ``operator'' is to have the 
meaning given such term in section 3 of the Mine Act.\27\ The Act also 
specifies that the term ``coal or other mine'' is to mean a coal or 
other mine as defined in section 3 of the Mine Act,\28\ that is subject 
to the provisions of the Mine Act.\29\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ Section 1503(e)(3) of the Act. Section 3(d) of the Mine Act 
provides that an ``operator'' means any owner, lessee, or other 
person who operates, controls, or supervises a coal or other mine or 
any independent contractor performing services or construction at 
such mine. 30 U.S.C. 802.
    \28\ Section 3(h) of the Mine Act:
    (1) ``Coal or other mine'' means (A) an area of land from which 
minerals are extracted in nonliquid form or, if in liquid form, are 
extracted with workers underground, (B) private ways and roads 
appurtenant to such area, and (C) lands, excavations, underground 
passageways, shafts, slopes, tunnels and workings, structures, 
facilities, equipment, machines, tools, or other property including 
impoundments, retention dams, and tailings ponds, on the surface or 
underground, used in, or to be used in, or resulting from, the work 
of extracting such minerals from their natural deposits in nonliquid 
form, or if in liquid form, with workers underground, or used in, or 
to be used in, the milling of such minerals, or the work of 
preparing coal or other minerals, and includes custom coal 
preparation facilities. In making a determination of what 
constitutes mineral milling for purposes of this Act, the Secretary 
shall give due consideration to the convenience of administration 
resulting from the delegation to one Assistant Secretary of all 
authority with respect to the health and safety of miners employed 
at one physical establishment;
    (2) For purposes of titles II, III, and IV, ``coal mine'' means 
an area of land and all structures, facilities, machinery tools, 
equipment, shafts, slopes, tunnels, excavations, and other property, 
real or personal, placed upon, under, or above the surface of such 
land by any person, used in, or to be used in, or resulting from, 
the work of extracting in such area bituminous coal, lignite, or 
anthracite from its natural deposits in the earth by any means or 
method, and the work of preparing the coal so extracted, and 
includes custom coal preparation facilities;
    \29\ Section 1503(e)(2) of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are proposing to include references to these definitions in new 
Item 106 \30\ and Item 601(b)(95) \31\ of Regulation S-K, the 
instructions to new Item 16J of Form 20-F \32\ and the notes to new 
Paragraph (18) of General Instruction B of Form 40-F.\33\ Because the 
Act's definition of ``coal or other mine'' is limited to those mines 
that are subject to the provisions of the Mine Act, and the Mine Act 
applies only to mines located in the United States,\34\ we are 
proposing that, for each required disclosure item discussed below,\35\ 
the information would be required only for coal or other mines (as 
defined in the Mine Act) located in the United States. As a result, 
issuers that operate (or have subsidiaries that operate) mines outside 
the United States would not have to disclose information about such 
mines under the proposal. Thus, for example, an issuer that operates 
mines in both the United States and Canada would only be required to 
include information about its U.S. mines. While our proposals are 
limited to implementing the requirements of the Act and, therefore, do 
not extend to foreign mines, to the extent mine safety issues are 
material under our current rules, disclosure could be required pursuant 
to the following items of Regulation S-K: Item 303 (Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations), Item 503(c) (Risk Factors), Item 101 (Description of 
Business) or Item 103 (Legal Proceedings).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ See proposed Item 106 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.106).
    \31\ See proposed Item 601(b)(95) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 
229.601(b)(95)).
    \32\ See instructions to proposed Item 16J under Part II of Form 
20-F.
    \33\ See notes to proposed Paragraph (18) of General Instruction 
B of Form 40-F.
    \34\ The Mine Act covers each ``coal or other mine, the products 
of which enter commerce, or the operations or products of which 
affect commerce, and each operator of such mine, and every miner in 
such mine * * *'' 30 U.S.C. 803. `` `Commerce' means trade, traffic, 
commerce, transportation, or communication among the several States, 
or between a place in a State and any place outside thereof, or 
within the District of Columbia or a possession of the United 
States, or between points in the same State but through a point 
outside thereof.'' 30 U.S.C. 802(b). `` `State' includes a State of 
the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Trust 
Territory of the Pacific Islands.'' 30 U.S.C. 802(c).
    \35\ See Section II.A.4 below for a discussion of the proposed 
disclosure requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As proposed, we would include smaller reporting companies and 
foreign private issuers \36\ within the scope of the proposed rules 
implementing Section 1503(a) of the Act. We believe their inclusion is 
consistent with the plain language of Section 1503(a), which applies 
broadly to issuers that are required to file reports under sections 
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Because foreign private issuers are 
not subject to Regulation S-K, we are proposing to amend Forms 20-F and 
40-F to require the specified mine safety disclosure about mines 
subject to the Mine Act operated by a foreign private issuer (or a 
subsidiary of such foreign private issuer).\37\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ See the definition of ``smaller reporting company'' in 17 
CFR 240.12b-2 and the definition of ``foreign private issuer'' in 17 
CFR 240.3b-4.
    \37\ See Section IX below for the text of proposed amendments. 
As discussed in Section II.B.3 below, we are not proposing to 
require foreign private issuers to comply with Section 1503(b) of 
the Act by filing Forms 8-K.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, we believe that the language of the Act referring to 
``each coal or other mine'' is intended to elicit disclosure of any 
citations, orders or violations for each distinct mine covered by the 
Mine Act, and is not intended to permit disclosure by grouping mines by 
project or geographic region.\38\ Although this approach may result in 
issuers reporting a significant volume of information in their periodic 
reports, this approach accords with the plain language of the Act. As 
noted above, information on a mine-by-mine basis is currently made 
publicly available through MSHA's data retrieval system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ To facilitate public input on implementation of the Act, 
the Commission has provided a series of e-mail links, organized by 
topic, on its website at <a href="http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/regreformcomments.shtml">http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/regreformcomments.shtml</a>. The public comments we received on the 
topic of mine safety disclosure are available on our website at 
<a href="http://www.sec.gov/comments/df-title-xv/specialized-disclosures/specializeddisclosures.shtml">http://www.sec.gov/comments/df-title-xv/specialized-disclosures/specializeddisclosures.shtml</a>. We received input from a commentator 
suggesting that the Commission adopt a materiality standard for 
reporting the matters under Section 1503(a) where an issuer has 
numerous operations. See letter from Rio Tinto. However, because 
Section 1503 does not appear to contemplate materiality thresholds, 
we are not proposing to include such a threshold for the disclosure 
requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Request for Comment
    (1) Section 1503 of the Act provides definitions of the terms 
``operator'' and ``coal or other mine'' but does not define the term 
``subsidiary.'' Under Item 1-02(x) of Regulation S-X, a ``subsidiary'' 
of a specified person is ``an affiliate controlled by such person 
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,'' which 
would apply to this disclosure in the absence of another definition. Is 
this definition appropriate for purposes of Section 1503, or should we 
include a different definition for ``subsidiary'' for purposes of 
Section 1503 disclosure? If so, how should we define that term?
    (2) In conformity with the language of Section 1503(a), we are 
proposing to apply the Act's periodic report disclosure requirement 
only to mines that are subject to the Mine Act, and not to mines in 
other jurisdictions. Is this approach appropriate? Will issuers that 
operate (or have subsidiaries that operate) mines in the United States 
be at a competitive advantage or disadvantage compared to issuers that 
operate mines in other jurisdictions because of the lack of disclosure 
about

[[Page 80377]]

non-U.S. mines? Should we instead expand the disclosure requirement to 
cover mines in all jurisdictions? If so, how would we address 
disclosure requirements for mines not subject to the Mine Act? How 
would we address the disclosure requirements if a jurisdiction does not 
have clear mine safety regulations?
    (3) Section 1503 of the Act does not contemplate an exception from 
disclosure for smaller reporting companies. Should the requirements 
apply to smaller reporting companies, as proposed, or should we exempt 
smaller reporting companies from the disclosure requirement or some 
portion of the disclosure requirement? Are there alternative 
accommodations we should consider for smaller reporting companies?
    (4) Section 1503 of the Act also does not contemplate any exception 
from disclosure for foreign private issuers. Should the requirements 
apply to foreign private issuers, as proposed? If not, why not?
    (5) As proposed, the required disclosure must be provided for each 
mine for which the issuer or a subsidiary of the issuer is an operator. 
How burdensome would such disclosure be for issuers to prepare? Could 
this approach produce such a volume of information that investors will 
be overwhelmed? Should we instead require disclosure by project or 
geographic region? Would this approach be consistent with Section 
1503(a) of the Act?
    (6) General Instruction I to Form 10-K and General Instruction H to 
Form 10-Q contain special provisions for the omission of certain 
information by wholly-owned subsidiaries. General Instruction J to Form 
10-K contains special provisions for the omission of certain 
information by asset-backed issuers. Should either or both of these 
types of registrants be permitted to omit the proposed mine safety 
disclosure in the annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on 
Form 10-Q?
2. Location of Disclosure
    The Act states that companies must include the disclosure in their 
periodic reports required pursuant to sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act. We are proposing to require issuers that have matters to 
report in accordance with Section 1503(a) to include brief disclosure 
in Part II of Form 10-Q, Part I of Form 10-K and Forms 20-F and 40-F 
noting that they have mine safety violations or other regulatory 
matters to report in accordance with Section 1503(a), and that the 
required information is included in an exhibit to the filing.\39\ The 
exhibit would include the detailed disclosure about specific violations 
and regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) as implemented in 
our new rules. We are proposing this approach in order to facilitate 
access to the information about detailed mine safety matters without 
overburdening the traditional Exchange Act reports with extensive new 
disclosures. We note that in the event that mine safety matters raise 
concerns that should be addressed in other parts of a periodic report, 
such as risk factors, the business description, legal proceedings or 
management's discussion and analysis, inclusion of this new disclosure 
would not obviate the need to discuss mine safety matters as 
appropriate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \39\ Proposed Item 4 under Part II of Form 10-Q, proposed Item 
4(b) under Part I of Form 10-K, proposed Item 16J under Part II of 
Form 20-F and proposed paragraph B.(18) under the General 
Instructions to Form 40-F.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are not proposing any particular presentation requirements for 
the new disclosure, although we encourage issuers to use tabular 
presentations whenever possible if to do so would facilitate investor 
understanding.
Request for Comment
    (7) Because the Act states that issuers must include the mine 
safety disclosure in each periodic report filed with the Commission, we 
are proposing to require the disclosure in each filing on Forms 10-Q, 
10-K, 20-F and 40-F. For issuers that file using the domestic forms 
(Forms 10-Q and 10-K), should we, instead only require the disclosure 
annually? Would such an approach be consistent with the Act?
    (8) As proposed, we would not specify a particular presentation for 
the disclosure. Should we require a specific presentation, tabular or 
otherwise? If so, please provide details on an appropriate 
presentation.
    (9) We are proposing to require the information to be presented in 
an exhibit to the periodic report, with brief disclosure in the body of 
the report noting that the issuer has mine safety matters to report and 
referring to the required exhibit. Is this approach appropriate? Should 
we instead require the information to be presented in the body of the 
periodic report?
    (10) As noted above, Section 1503(a) requires the disclosure to be 
included in periodic reports. Should we also require the information to 
be included in registration statements?
    (11) Should we require the disclosure to be provided in an 
interactive data format? Why or why not? Would investors find 
interactive data to be a useful tool to analyze the information 
provided and generate statistics for their own use? If so, what format 
would be most appropriate for providing standardized data disclosure--
for example, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) or eXtensible Business 
Reporting Language (XBRL)? Could the use of interactive data make it 
possible for issuers to reduce reporting costs by using the same data 
that is already available through MSHA's data retrieval system?
3. Time Periods Covered
    Section 1503(a) of the Act states that each periodic report must 
include disclosure ``for the time period covered by such report.'' 
Accordingly, we are proposing that each Form 10-Q would include the 
required disclosure for any orders, violations or citations received, 
penalties assessed or legal actions initiated during the quarter 
covered by the report.\40\ We are also proposing that each Form 10-K 
would include disclosure covering both the fourth quarter of the 
issuer's fiscal year, and cumulative information for the entire fiscal 
year. We believe this is consistent with Section 1503(a), since a Form 
10-K covers both the fourth quarter and the entire year. For each of 
Forms 20-F and 40-F, the disclosure would be required for the issuer's 
fiscal year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \40\ As noted in Sections II.A.4.f and j below, we are also 
proposing to require disclosure of the total amounts of assessments 
of penalties outstanding as of the last day of the quarter and of 
any developments material to previously reported legal actions that 
occur during the quarter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Because mine operators have the right to contest orders, violations 
or citations they receive through the administrative process,\41\ there 
is a possibility an operator's challenge would result in dismissal of 
the order, violation or citation or in a reduction in the severity of 
the order, violation or citation below the level that triggers 
disclosure under Section 1503(a). One mining company \42\ has suggested 
that we not require disclosure of citations that, prior to the periodic 
filing, have been dismissed or resolved such that they fall below the 
reportable level, or alternatively that the issuer be able to elaborate 
its position with respect to citations, such as whether the citations 
have been or will be challenged or if the issuer believes the severity 
of the citation is unwarranted. Based on the language of Section 
1503(a) of the Act, we are not proposing to allow issuers to exclude 
information about orders, violations or citations that were received 
during the time period covered by the report but

[[Page 80378]]

subsequently were dismissed or reduced. However, the proposal would not 
prohibit the inclusion of additional information to provide context to 
the required disclosure. We would expect that issuers will include 
disclosure that complies with our existing disclosure requirements when 
providing any such context.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Request for Comment
    (12) We are proposing to require the Form 10-K to include both 
disclosure about orders, citations, violations, assessments and legal 
actions received or initiated during the fourth quarter and the 
aggregate data for the whole year. Is this approach consistent with 
Section 1503(a)? Would it be consistent with Section 1503(a) to limit 
the information to the fourth quarter data? Alternatively, should we 
require the Form 10-K to include only fourth quarter information, or 
only the full year information?
    (13) As proposed, issuers would be required to report all orders, 
violations or citations received during the period covered by the 
report, regardless of whether such order, violation or citation was 
subsequently dismissed or reduced below a reportable level prior to the 
filing of the periodic report. Should we instead allow such orders, 
violations or citations to be excluded from the disclosure?
4. Required Disclosure Items
    Section 1503(a) of the Act includes a list of items to be disclosed 
in periodic reports. We are reiterating those items in new proposed 
Item 106 of Regulation S-K.\43\ In addition, we are proposing 
instructions to certain of the disclosure items specified in Section 
1503(a) to clarify the scope of the disclosure we would expect issuers 
to provide in order to comply with the statute's requirements. In 
addition, in order to provide context to investors, we are proposing 
one additional disclosure item not required by the Act that would 
require issuers to briefly describe the categories of violations, 
orders or citations included in the other items required by Section 
1503(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \43\ In this release, we reference new Item 106 of Regulation S-
K when discussing the proposed disclosure requirements, but note 
that the same analyses apply to the corresponding provisions in 
proposed Item 16J of Form 20-F and proposed Paragraph (18) of 
General Instruction B of Form 40-F.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We discuss each disclosure item below. Under our proposal, each 
issuer that is required under Section 1503(a) to provide this 
disclosure \44\ would be required to provide the following for each 
coal or other mine \45\ for the time period covered by the report (as 
discussed above).\46\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \44\ See Section II.A.1 above.
    \45\ See Section II.A.1 above.
    \46\ See Section II.A.3 above. Note that compliance with Section 
1503 of the Act is currently required, regardless of whether we 
adopt the proposed changes to our disclosure rules.

    a. The total number of violations of mandatory health or safety 
standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to 
the cause and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard 
under section 104 of the Mine Act for which the operator received a 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
citation from MSHA.

    Section 104 of the Mine Act requires MSHA inspectors to issue 
various citations or orders for violations of health or safety 
standards.\47\ Violations are cited by MSHA inspectors, giving the 
operator time for abatement of the violation. A violation of a 
mandatory safety standard that is reasonably likely to result in a 
reasonably serious injury or illness under the unique circumstance 
contributed to by the violation is referred to by MSHA as a 
``significant and substantial'' violation (commonly called a ``S&S'' 
violation).\48\ In writing each citation or order, the MSHA inspector 
determines whether the violation is ``S&S'' or not.\49\ The MSHA data 
retrieval system currently provides information about all citations and 
orders issued and notes which of those citations or orders are ``S&S.''

safety standard, whether there is a discrete safety or health hazard 
contributed to by the violation, whether there is a reasonable 
likelihood that the hazard contributed to will result in an injury 
or illness, and whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the 
injury or illness in question will be of a reasonably serious 
nature. Id.

    Because the language of Section 1503(a)(1)(A) references violations 
that could ``significantly and substantially contribute to the cause 
and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard under 
section 104'' of the Mine Act, we are proposing to require disclosure 
under this item of all citations received under section 104 of the Mine 
Act that note an S&S violation.
Request for Comment
    (14) Is it appropriate to limit this disclosure item to only S&S 
violations, or should we require disclosure of every violation under 
section 104 of the Mine Act? \51\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \51\ MSHA reports that in 2009 (preliminary), of the 175,079 
citations and orders issued and not vacated, 33% were designated 
S&S. In 2008, of the 174,473 citations and orders issued by MSHA and 
not vacated, 30% were designated S&S. See U.S. Department of Labor, 
Mine Safety and Health Administration, Mine Safety and Health at a 
Glance (May 19, 2010), available at <a href="http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT10.HTM">http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT10.HTM</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    b. The total number of orders issued under section 104(b) of the 
Mine Act.
    Section 104(b) of the Mine Act covers violations that had 
previously been cited under section 104(a) that, upon follow-up 
inspection by MSHA, are found not to have been totally abated within 
the prescribed time period, which results in the issuance of an order 
requiring the mine operator to immediately withdraw all persons (except 
certain authorized persons) from the mine. The proposed rule would 
implement the Act's requirement to disclose this information.
    The total number of citations and orders for unwarrantable failure 
of the mine operator to comply with mandatory health and safety 
standards under section 104(d) of the Mine Act.
    Section 104(d) of the Mine Act covers similar violations as 
discussed above, except that the standard is that the violation could 
significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a 
safety or health hazard, but the conditions do not cause imminent 
danger, and the inspector finds that the violation is caused by an 
unwarrantable failure of the operator to comply with the health and 
safety standards. The proposed rule would implement the Act's 
requirement to disclose this information.
    c. The total number of flagrant violations under section 110(b)(2) 
of the Mine Act.
    Section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act is a penalty provision that 
provides that violations that are deemed to be ``flagrant'' may be 
assessed a maximum civil penalty. The term ``flagrant'' with respect to 
a violation means ``a reckless or repeated failure to make reasonable 
efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory health or safety 
standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could 
have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury.'' \52\ The 
proposed rule would implement the Act's requirement to disclose this 
information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \52\ 30 U.S.C. 820(b)(2).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 80379]]

    d. The total number of imminent danger orders issued under section 
107(a) of the Mine Act.
    An imminent danger order is issued under section 107(a) of the Mine 
Act if the MSHA inspector determines there is an imminent danger in the 
mine. The order requires the operator of the mine to cause all persons 
(except certain authorized persons) to be withdrawn from the mine until 
the imminent danger and the conditions that caused such imminent danger 
cease to exist. This type of order does not preclude the issuance of a 
citation under section 104 or a penalty under section 110. The proposed 
rule would implement the Act's requirement to disclose this 
information.
    e. The total dollar value of proposed assessments from MSHA under 
the Mine Act.
    Each issuance of a citation or order by MSHA results in the 
assessment of a civil penalty against the mine operator. Penalties are 
assessed according to a formula that considers several factors, 
including a history of previous violations, size of operator's 
business, negligence by the operator, gravity of the violation, 
operator's good faith in trying to correct the violation promptly and 
the effect of the penalty on the operator's ability to stay in 
business.\53\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \53\ 30 U.S.C. 815(b)(1)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Because Section 1503(a) requires issuers to disclose the total 
dollar value of proposed assessments ``for the time period covered by'' 
the periodic report, we are proposing to require that issuers disclose 
the total dollar amount of assessments of penalties proposed by MSHA 
during the time period covered by the report. We are also proposing 
that the disclosure include the cumulative total of all proposed 
assessments of penalties outstanding as of the last day of the period 
covered by the report. We understand that proposed assessments may 
remain outstanding for extended periods of time, and believe such 
disclosure would provide a clearer picture of the most current health 
and safety issues for the issuer, as well as information about the 
magnitude of outstanding penalty assessments.
    When any civil penalty is proposed to be assessed by MSHA, the mine 
operator has 30 days following receipt of the notice of proposed 
penalty to pay the penalty or file a contest and request a hearing 
before a FMSHRC administrative law judge.\54\ Because Section 
1503(a)(1)(F) of the Act references the total dollar amount of proposed 
assessments from MSHA during the time period covered by the report, we 
are proposing that this disclosure include any dollar amounts of 
penalty assessments proposed during the time period that the issuer is 
contesting with MSHA or the FMSHRC. However, the proposal would not 
prohibit the inclusion of additional information noting that certain 
proposed assessments of penalties are being contested to provide 
context to the required disclosure. We would expect that issuers will 
include disclosure that complies with our existing disclosure 
requirements when providing any such context.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \54\ See 30 CFR 100.7. If the proposed penalty is not paid or 
contested within 30 days of receipt, the proposed penalty becomes a 
final order of the FMSHRC and is not subject to review by any court 
or agency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Request for Comment
    (15) As proposed, the new rules would require disclosure of the 
total dollar amounts of assessments of penalties proposed by MSHA 
during the time period covered by the report, and also the cumulative 
total of all proposed assessments of penalties outstanding as of the 
date of the report. Is this approach appropriate?
    (16) As proposed, issuers would be required to include in the total 
dollar amount any proposed assessments of penalties that are being 
contested. Should issuers be permitted to exclude proposed assessments 
that are being contested? Should issuers be permitted to note the 
contested amounts separately?
    f. The total number of mining-related fatalities.
    Section 1503(a)(1)(G) of the Act sets forth the requirement to 
disclose the total number of mining-related fatalities, and our 
proposed rule would set forth this requirement. We note that Section 
1503(a)(1)(G) is the only provision of the Act that does not 
specifically reference the Mine Act, a specific notice, order or 
citation from MSHA, or the FMSHRC. However, because, as discussed 
above,\55\ the application of Section 1503 is limited to mines that are 
subject to the provisions of the Mine Act, we believe that this 
disclosure requirement encompasses mining-related fatalities only at 
mines that are subject to the Mine Act. MSHA regulations require the 
reporting of all fatalities at a mine.\56\ MSHA has also established 
policies and procedures for determining whether a fatality is unrelated 
to mining activity (commonly referred to as ``non-chargeable'' to the 
mining industry).\57\ Since the MSHA regulations provide a 
comprehensive scheme of regulation, reporting and assessment for mine-
related fatalities, we believe the disclosure required by this section 
is intended to include all fatalities that are required to be disclosed 
under MSHA regulations, unless the fatality is determined to be ``non-
chargeable'' to the mining industry.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    MSHA regulations require the operator of a mine to contact MSHA at 
once without delay and within 15 minutes at a toll-free number, once 
the operator knows or should know that an accident has occurred 
involving: (a) A death of an individual at the mine; (b) an injury of 
an individual at the mine which has a reasonable potential to cause 
death; (c) an entrapment of an individual at the mine which has a 
reasonable potential to cause death; or (d) any other accident.\58\ In 
addition, MSHA regulations require each operator to prepare and file a 
report with MSHA of each accident, occupational injury, or occupational 
illness occurring at each mine, indicating therein whether such injury 
or illness resulted in death.\59\

    MSHA investigates all deaths on mine property.\60\ Deaths that have 
been determined to be ``non-chargeable'' are not counted in the 
statistics MSHA uses to assess the safety performance of the mining 
industry.\61\ These ``non-chargeable'' deaths include, among other 
things, homicides, suicides, deaths due to natural causes, and deaths 
involving trespassers.\62\ In cases where it is questionable whether a 
death is chargeable to the mining industry, MSHA may refer the case to 
its Fatality Review Committee.\63\ Each of the four members of the 
Fatality Review Committee conducts an independent review of the facts 
and circumstances surrounding the questionable death to determine 
whether it is chargeable to the mining industry.\64\

    The proposed disclosure requirement encompasses all fatalities 
required to be reported pursuant to MSHA regulations, unless the 
fatality has been determined to be ``non-chargeable'' to the mining 
industry. We believe that this interpretation of the statutory language

[[Page 80380]]

is appropriate because it will result in consistency among reporting 
obligations.
Request for Comment
    (17) As proposed, we would require disclosure of mining-related 
fatalities only at mines that are subject to the Mine Act. However, 
many foreign jurisdictions already require mine operators to report 
mining-related fatalities.\65\ Would it be more appropriate to instead 
require disclosure of mining-related fatalities at all mines operated 
by companies that file periodic reports with the Commission, regardless 
of the location of the mine? For example, under such an approach, a 
foreign private issuer would have to disclose all mining-related 
fatalities at mines in its home country or any other jurisdiction, and 
domestic issuers would be required to disclose mining-related 
fatalities at mines outside of the United States. Would this be 
appropriate? How difficult would it be for issuers to compile and 
report this information? Would such an approach impose significant 
costs on issuers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \65\ See e.g., Mines Safety and Inspection Act 1994 (Western 
Australia); Mine Health and Safety Act, 1996, Department of Mineral 
Resources Regulations, Chapter 23--Reporting of Accidents and 
Dangerous Occurences (Republic of South Africa).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (18) Should we, as proposed, require disclosure of all fatalities 
required to be reported pursuant to MSHA regulations, unless the 
fatality has been determined to be ``non-chargeable'' to the mining 
industry? Should we add an instruction to the rule specifying this 
interpretation of the disclosure requirement? Would it be more 
appropriate to instead require disclosure of all fatalities regardless 
of the determination that it was ``non-chargeable''? Should we provide 
further guidance as to the timing of reporting for fatalities that are 
under review by MSHA's Fatality Review Committee?
    (19) If we were to require disclosure of mining-related fatalities 
regardless of the location of the mine, what standard, if any, should 
we apply for determining whether a fatality is related or unrelated to 
mining activity? For example, would it be appropriate to apply the MSHA 
framework to non-U.S. jurisdictions, or to look to each non-U.S. 
jurisdiction's mine safety regulatory scheme for guidance?
    g. A list of mines for which the issuer or a subsidiary received 
written notice from MHSA of a pattern of violations of mandatory health 
or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly 
and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other 
mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the Mine Act.
    If MSHA determines that a mine has a ``pattern'' of violations of 
mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could 
have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and 
effect of coal or other mine health or safety hazards, under section 
104(e) of the Mine Act and MSHA regulations the agency is required to 
notify the operator of the existence of such pattern. The proposed rule 
would implement the Act's requirement to disclose this information.
    h. A list of mines for which the issuer or a subsidiary received 
written notice from MHSA of the potential to have such a pattern.
    MSHA regulations state that MSHA will give the operator written 
notice of the potential to have a pattern of violations of mandatory 
health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have 
significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of 
coal or other mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the 
Mine Act.\66\ The proposed rule would implement the Act's requirement 
to disclose this information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \66\ See 30 CFR 104.4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    i. Any pending legal action before the Federal Mine Safety and 
Health Review Commission involving such coal or other mine.
    The FMSHRC is an independent agency established by the Mine Act 
that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal 
disputes arising under the Mine Act.\67\ We are proposing that any 
legal actions before the FMSHRC involving a coal or other mine for 
which the issuer or a subsidiary of the issuer is the operator be 
disclosed in the periodic report covering the time period during which 
the legal action was initiated. This disclosure would include, but not 
be limited to, any actions brought by the issuer or a subsidiary of the 
issuer before the FMSHRC to contest citations or penalties imposed by 
MSHA.\68\ As proposed, the new rules would require the information 
about pending legal actions to be updated in subsequent periodic 
reports if there are developments material to the legal action that 
occur during the time period covered by such report.\69\ Mine operators 
frequently contest proposed assessments \70\ and we believe that 
information about the resolution of pending legal actions would be 
useful in this context.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \67\ 30 U.S.C. 815(d).
    \68\ Other types of cases that would be disclosed include, for 
example, those relating to orders to close a mine, miners' charges 
of safety related discrimination or miners' requests for 
compensation after a mine is idled by a closure order. See ``About 
FMSHRC'' at <a href="http://www.fmshrc.gov/fmshrc.html">http://www.fmshrc.gov/fmshrc.html</a>.
    \69\ See Section IX below for the text of proposed amendments.
    \70\ See Number of Penalties Assessed and Percent Contested, 
January 2007--July 2010 (Graphs and Charts), as of 09/09/2010, 
available at <a href="http://www.msha.gov/stats/ContestedCitations/Civil%20Penalties%20Assessed%20and%20Contested.pdf">http://www.msha.gov/stats/ContestedCitations/Civil%20Penalties%20Assessed%20and%20Contested.pdf</a>. The graphs 
illustrate that during the time period between January 2007 through 
July 2010, the percent of penalties contested ranged from 
approximately 10% to approximately 30% of the number of penalties 
assessed, and the percent of penalty dollars contested ranged from 
approximately 30% to approximately 75% of the penalty dollars 
assessed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As proposed, the disclosure required by this item would include the 
date the pending legal action was instituted and by whom (e.g., MSHA or 
the mine operator), the name and location of mine involved, and a brief 
description of the category of violation, order or citation underlying 
the proceeding. We believe this limited additional information is 
necessary to make the information more useful to investors by putting 
the disclosure in context.
Request for Comment
    (20) As proposed, information about pending legal actions would be 
disclosed in the periodic report covering the period in which the 
action was initiated, with updates in subsequent reports for 
developments material to the pending action. Is this appropriate? 
Should we instead limit the disclosure to only those legal actions 
initiated during the period covered by the periodic report? Should we 
specifically require issuers to provide disclosure when a contested 
assessment has been vacated during the time period covered by the 
report?
    (21) Is the contextual information we are proposing to require to 
be included for each pending legal action appropriate? Should we 
require any other information about pending legal actions to be 
disclosed?
    j. A brief description of each category of violations, orders and 
citations reported
    Although not required by Section 1503 of the Act, we are proposing 
to require issuers to provide a brief description of each category of 
violations, orders and citations reported under new Items 106(a)(1) and 
106(a)(2) of Regulation S-K \71\ so that investors can understand the 
basis for the violations, orders or citations

[[Page 80381]]

referenced. For example, we would expect that an issuer that reports 
receipt of an order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act would include 
disclosure stating that such orders are issued for situations in which 
MSHA determines an imminent danger exists and result in orders of 
immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the 
condition. We believe this is appropriate to provide investors with 
context to the disclosure required by Section 1503(a) of the Act. We 
are concerned that without such a requirement, investors may be 
presented with disclosure that simply references the various provisions 
of the Mine Act, and would have to research the Mine Act and MSHA's 
rules to be able to assess the information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \71\ This proposed requirement would also apply to the 
corresponding categories of citations, orders and violations to be 
reported under proposed Item 16J(a) and (b) of Form 20-F and 
proposed Paragraph (18)(a) and (b) to General Instruction B of Form 
40-F.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Request for Comment
    (22) Will the proposed disclosure providing a brief description of 
each category of violations, orders and citations reported be useful 
for investors, or would the information otherwise provided in the 
proposed exhibit to the periodic report be sufficient? Is there any 
other disclosure we should require in order to put the disclosures 
required by Section 1503(a) of the Act in context for investors?

B. Form 8-K Filing Requirement

1. Triggering Events
    Section 1503(b) of the Act requires each issuer that is an 
operator, or has a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other 
mine to report on Form 8-K the receipt of certain notices from 
MSHA.\72\ We are proposing to revise Form 8-K to add new Item 1.04, 
which would require filing of Form 8-K within four business days of the 
receipt by an issuer (or a subsidiary of the issuer) of:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

written notice from MSHA of the potential to have a pattern of 
violations under section 104(e) of the Mine Act [30 U.S.C. 814(e)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    These orders and notices are also required to be disclosed under 
Section 1503(a) of the Act in issuers' periodic reports. We believe the 
plain language of Section 1503 of the Act requires such orders and 
notices to be reported both in issuers' Forms 8-K and their periodic 
reports. For example, if an issuer receives from MSHA one of the orders 
or notices specified above during the second quarter of the year, the 
issuer would file a Form 8-K reporting the receipt of the order or 
notice within four business days of receipt, include information about 
such order or notice in accordance with new Regulation S-K Item 106 in 
its Form 10-Q for the second quarter and include information regarding 
this violation in the annual cumulative total for the fiscal year in 
its Form 10-K for that fiscal year.
Request for Comment
    (23) The events that would trigger filing under proposed Item 1.04 
are also events that are required to be disclosed in periodic reports 
under Section 1503(a) of the Act and our proposed Item 106 of 
Regulation S-K. Should we revise our proposal to minimize duplicative 
disclosure such as by not requiring repetition of information 
previously reported? Would such an approach be consistent with the Act? 
Would our proposed disclosure approach be unduly burdensome for issuers 
or confusing to investors?
2. Required Disclosure and Filing Deadline
    Section 1503(b) of the Act does not specify the disclosure that 
issuers should provide in the required Form 8-K filing. We are 
proposing that new Item 1.04 of Form 8-K require, in each case, 
disclosure of the date of receipt of the order or notice, the category 
of order or notice, and the name and location of the mine involved.
    In addition, Section 1503(b) of the Act does not specify a filing 
deadline for the required Form 8-K. Consistent with our approach to 
other Form 8-K items, we are proposing that the current report under 
new Item 1.04 be required to be filed no later than four business days 
after the triggering event. We believe that, because the triggering 
events are clear and do not require management to make rapid 
materiality judgments, the four business day deadline provides adequate 
time for issuers to prepare accurate and complete information.
Request for Comment
    (24) Is there any other information that should be required to be 
disclosed under proposed Item 1.04 of Form 8-K? Will the information 
that we are proposing to require in the Form 8-K be useful for 
investors?
    (25) Should the filing period for a Form 8-K under proposed Item 
1.04 be four business days, as proposed, or should the filing period be 
longer? What factors should we consider in deciding whether to make the 
filing period longer?
3. Treatment of Foreign Private Issuers
    Foreign private issuers are not required to file current reports on 
Form 8-K.\76\ Instead, they are required to file under the cover of 
Form 6-K \77\ copies of all information that the foreign private issuer 
makes, or is required to make, public under the laws of its 
jurisdiction of incorporation, files, or is required to file, under the 
rules of any stock exchange, or otherwise distributes to its security 
holders.\78\ We do not propose to change these reporting 
requirements.\79\ As described above,\80\ we are proposing changes to 
Forms 20-F and 40-F that would require a foreign private issuer to 
disclose in each annual report the items described in Section 1503(a) 
of the Act. The proposed amendments include the same information that 
will be required of other issuers, including disclosure of the receipt 
during the foreign private issuer's past fiscal year of any imminent 
danger order issued under section 107(a) of the Mine Act,\81\ written 
notice from MSHA of a pattern of violations of mandatory health or 
safety standards that are of such a nature as could have significantly 
and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other 
mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the Mine Act,\82\ 
or written notice from

MSHA of the potential to have a pattern of such violations.\83\

Request for Comment
    (26) Should we require foreign private issuers to file disclosure 
about the receipt of imminent danger orders or notices of a pattern or 
potential pattern of violations within four days under cover of Form 8-
K, Form 6-K or a special report on Form 20-F? Should we otherwise 
require a foreign private issuer to promptly disclose the receipt of 
such order or notices? Does a divergent treatment of U.S. issuers and 
foreign private issuers in connection with current reporting 
disadvantage U.S. issuers? Should this be addressed in our rules, and 
if so, how? To what extent, if any, would foreign private issuers have 
additional burdens or costs associated with reporting these events on a 
current basis?

C. Amendment to General Instruction I.A.3.(b) of Form S-3

    We are proposing to amend General Instruction I.A.3.(b) of Form S-3 
to provide that an untimely filing on Form 8-K regarding new Item 1.04 
would not result in loss of Form S-3 eligibility. Under our existing 
rules, the untimely filing on Form 8-K of certain items does not result 
in loss of Form S-3 eligibility, so long as Form 8-K reporting is 
current at the time the Form S-3 is filed. We believe that it is 
appropriate to add proposed Item 1.04 to the list of Form 8-K items in 
General Instruction I.A.3.(b) of Form S-3.
    In the past, when we have adopted new disclosure requirements that 
differed from the traditional periodic reporting obligations of 
companies, we have acknowledged concerns about the potentially harsh 
consequences of the loss of Form S-3 eligibility, and addressed such 
concerns by specifying that untimely filing of Form 8-K relating to 
certain topics would not result in the loss of Form S-3 
eligibility.\84\ We note that Section 1503(b) of the Act does not 
address the Securities Act implications of a failure to timely file a 
Form 8-K. Therefore, we are proposing to provide that untimely filing 
of the new Item 1.04 Form 8-K would not result in the loss of Form S-3 
eligibility.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \84\ See Selective Disclosure and Insider Trading, SEC Release 
No. 33-7881 (Aug. 15, 2000) [65 FR 51715]; Additional Form 8-K 
Disclosure Requirements and Acceleration of Filing Date, SEC Release 
No. 33-8400 (March 16, 2004) [69 FR 15594] (the ``Additional Form 8-
K Disclosure Release'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are not proposing to include new Item 1.04 in the list in Rules 
13a-11(c) and 15d-11(c) under the Exchange Act of Form 8-K items 
eligible for a limited safe harbor from liability under Section 10(b) 
or Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act.\85\ In 2004, when we adopted the 
limited safe harbor, we noted our view that the safe harbor is 
appropriate if the triggering event for the Form 8-K requires 
management to make a rapid materiality determination.\86\ The filing of 
an Item 1.04 Form 8-K is triggered by an event that does not require 
management to make a rapid materiality determination, and we believe 
that it is not necessary to extend the safe harbor to this new item. We 
solicit comment below on whether this treatment is appropriate for 
proposed Item 1.04.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \85\ Rules 13a-11(c) and 15d-11(c) each provides that ``[n]o 
failure to file a report on Form 8-K that is required solely 
pursuant to Item 1.01, 1.02, 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 4.02(a), 
5.02(e) or 6.03 of Form 8-K shall be deemed a violation of'' Section 
10(b) of the Exchange Act or Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
    \86\ Additional Form 8-K Disclosure Release at 69 FR 15607.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Request for Comment
    (27) Should we, as proposed, amend General Instruction I.A.3(b) of 
Form S-3 to add proposed Item 1.04 to the list of items on Form 8-K 
with respect to which an issuer's failure timely to file the Form 8-K 
will not result in the loss of Form S-3 eligibility? Why or why not? If 
we were to adopt a current reporting requirement for foreign private 
issuers for the information covered by Section 1503(b) of the Act, 
should we approach Form F-3 eligibility in the same manner?
    (28) As proposed, we would not include proposed Item 1.04 in the 
list of items in Rules 13a-11(c) and 15d-11(c) with respect to which 
the failure to file a report on Form 8-K will not be deemed to be a 
violation of Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. Should we instead add 
proposed Item 1.04 to the safe harbor? Why or why not?

III. General Request for Comment

    We request and encourage any interested person to submit comments 
on any aspect of our proposals, other matters that might have an impact 
on the amendments, and any suggestions for additional changes. With 
respect to any comments, we note that they are of greatest assistance 
to our rulemaking initiative if accompanied by supporting data and 
analysis of the issues addressed in those comments and by alternatives 
to our proposals where appropriate.

IV. Paperwork Reduction Act

A. Background

    Certain provisions of the proposed amendments contain ``collection 
of information'' requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA).\87\ We are submitting the proposed 
amendments to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review in 
accordance with the PRA.\88\ The titles for the collection of 
information are:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \87\ 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
    \88\ 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (A) ``Regulation S-K'' (OMB Control No. 3235-0071);
    (B) ``Form 10-K'' (OMB Control No. 3235-0063);
    (C) ``Form 10-Q'' (OMB Control No. 3235-0070);
    (D) ``Form 8-K'' (OMB Control No. 3235-0060);
    (E) ``Form 20-F'' (OMB Control No. 3235-0288); and
    (F) ``Form 40-F'' (OMB Control No. 3235-0381).
    These regulations and forms were adopted under the Securities Act 
and the Exchange Act. They set forth the disclosure requirements for 
periodic and current reports filed by companies to inform 
investors.\89\ The hours and costs associated with preparing 
disclosure, filing forms and retaining records constitute reporting and 
cost burdens imposed by each collection of information. An agency may 
not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \89\ Forms 20-F and 40-F may also be used by foreign private 
issuers to register a class of securities under the Exchange Act. In 
addition, Form 20-F sets forth many of the disclosure requirements 
for registration statements filed by foreign private issuers under 
the Securities Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As discussed in more detail above, the proposed rule and form 
amendments would implement Section 1503 of the Act. Section 1503(a) 
requires issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is 
an operator, of a coal or other mine to disclose in their periodic 
reports filed with the Commission information regarding specified 
health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments 
and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities. Section 1503(b) of 
the Act mandates the filing of a Form 8-K disclosing the receipt of 
certain orders and notices from MSHA. We are proposing to add new Items 
106 and 601(b)(95) to Regulation S-K and amend Forms 10-Q, 10-K, 20-F 
and 40-F under the Exchange Act to implement and, to a limited degree, 
enhance the

[[Page 80383]]

disclosure requirement set forth in Section 1503(a) of the Act. We are 
also proposing to add new Item 1.04 to Form 8-K to implement the 
requirement of Section 1503(b) of the Act. In addition, we are 
proposing to amend General Instruction I.A.3(b) of Securities Act Form 
S-3.
    Issuers are currently required to comply with the provisions of 
Section 1503 of the Act, therefore the Act has already increased the 
burdens and costs for issuers by requiring the disclosure set forth in 
Sections 1503(a) and (b) of the Act. Most of the information called for 
by the new disclosure requirements is publicly disclosed by MSHA and 
readily available to issuers, who receive the notices, orders and 
citations directly from MSHA and can also access the information via 
MSHA's data retrieval system. Further, the proposed disclosure item for 
periodic reports requiring disclosure of mining-related fatalities is 
already subject to a collection of information under MSHA 
regulations.\90\ Our proposed amendments would incorporate the Act's 
requirements into Regulation S-K and related forms, and would require 
certain additional disclosure to provide context to the disclosure 
items required by the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \90\ 30 CFR 50.10 and 50.20.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We anticipate that the proposed new Items 106 and 601(b)(95) of 
Regulation S-K would increase existing disclosure burdens for annual 
reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q by requiring 
disclosure about certain mine health and safety violations designated 
by the Act. Because Regulation S-K does not apply directly to Forms 20-
F and 40-F,\91\ we propose to amend those forms to include the same 
disclosure requirements as those proposed for issuers that are not 
foreign private issuers.\92\ We anticipate that new Item 1.04 of Form 
8-K would increase the existing disclosure burden for current reports 
on Form 8-K by requiring issuers to file a Form 8-K upon receipt of 
three types of notices or orders from MSHA relating to mine health and 
safety concerns and specifying the information required about the 
orders or notices required to be disclosed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \91\ While Form 20-F may be used by any foreign private issuer, 
Form 40-F is only available to a Canadian issuer that is eligible to 
participate in the U.S.-Canadian Multijurisdictional Disclosure 
System (``MJDS'').
    \92\ Proposed Item 16J under Part II of Form 20-F and proposed 
paragraph (18) to General Instruction B of Form 40-F.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Compliance with the proposed amendments would be mandatory. 
Responses to the information collections would not be kept 
confidential, and there would be no mandatory retention period for the 
information disclosed.

B. Burden and Cost Estimates Related to the Proposed Amendments

    We anticipate that the proposed rule and form amendments, if 
adopted, would increase the burdens and costs for issuers that would be 
subject to the proposed amendments. For purposes of the PRA, we 
estimate the total annual increase in paperwork burden for all affected 
companies to comply with our proposed collection of information 
requirements to be approximately 1,677 hours of company personnel time 
and approximately $263,500 for the services of outside professionals. 
These estimates include the time and the cost of implementing 
disclosure controls and procedures, preparing and reviewing disclosure, 
filing documents and retaining records. In deriving our estimates, we 
assume that:
    <bullet> For Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, an issuer incurs 75% of the 
annual burden required to produce each form, and outside firms, 
including legal counsel, accountants and other advisors retained by the 
issuer incur 25% of the annual burden required to produce the form at 
an average cost of $400 per hour; \93\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \93\ The $400 per hour cost for outside legal services is the 
same estimate used by the Commission for these services in the 
proposed consolidated audit trail rule: Exchange Act Release No. 
62174 (May 26, 2010): 75 FR 32556 (June 8, 2010).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> For Forms 20-F and 40-F, a foreign private issuer incurs 
25% of the annual burden required to produce each form, and outside 
firms retained by the issuer incur 75% of the burden require to produce 
each form at an average cost of $400 per hour.

The portion of the burden carried by outside professionals is reflected 
as a cost, while the portion of the burden carried by the company 
internally is reflected in hours.

    We have based our estimates of the effect that the adopted rule and 
form amendments would have on those collections of information 
primarily on our understanding that the information required to be 
disclosed is readily available to issuers, and that therefore the 
burden imposed by the disclosure requirements is mainly in formatting 
the information in order to comply with our disclosure requirements and 
ensuring that appropriate disclosure controls and procedures are in 
place to facilitate reporting of the information. In this regard, we 
note that mine operators receive the relevant notices, citations and 
similar information directly from MSHA, and that issuers could also 
access the information via MSHA's publicly available data retrieval 
system.
1. Regulation S-K
    While the proposed rule and form amendments would make revisions to 
Regulation S-K, the collection of information requirements for that 
regulation are reflected in the burden hours estimated for Forms 10-K 
and 10-Q. The rules in Regulation S-K do not impose any separate 
burden. Consistent with historical practice, we are proposing to retain 
an estimate of one burden hour to Regulation S-K for administrative 
convenience.
2. Form 10-K
    Based on a review of companies filing under certain SICs, as well 
as a review of companies that are currently providing disclosure of 
mine safety violations in Commission filings in accordance with Section 
1503 of the Act, we estimate that, of the 13,545 Form 10-Ks filed 
annually, approximately 95 are filed by companies that operate, or have 
a subsidiary that operates, a mine subject to the Mine Act, and that 
therefore would be affected by the proposed rule and form amendments. 
For purposes of the PRA, we assume that each such filer would have 
disclosures about mine safety violations to include in its Form 10-K. 
We further estimate that the proposed rule and form amendments would 
add 5 burden hours to the total burden hours required to produce each 
Form 10-K.
3. Form 20-F
    Based on a review of companies filing under certain SICs, as well 
as a review of companies that are currently providing disclosure of 
mine safety violations in Commission filings in accordance with Section 
1503 of the Act, we currently estimate that of the 942 Form 20-F annual 
reports filed annually by foreign private issuers, approximately 15 are 
filed by companies that operate, or have a subsidiary that operates, a 
mine subject to the Mine Act, and that therefore would be affected by 
the proposed rule and form amendments. For purposes of the PRA, we 
assume that each such filer would have disclosures about mine safety 
violations to include in its Form 20-F. As with Form 10-K, we estimate 
that the proposed rule and form amendments would add 5 burden hours to 
the total burden hours required to produce each Form 20-F.

[[Page 80384]]

4. Form 40-F
    Based on a review of companies filing under certain SICs, as well 
as a review of companies that are currently providing disclosure of 
mine safety violations in Commission filings in accordance with Section 
1503 of the Act, we currently estimate that of the 205 Form 40-F annual 
reports filed annually by foreign private issuers, approximately 15 are 
filed by companies that operate, or have a subsidiary that operates, a 
mine subject to the Mine Act, and that therefore would be affected by 
the proposed rule and form amendments. For purposes of the PRA, we 
assume that each such filer would have disclosures about mine safety 
violations to include in its Form 40-F. As with Forms 10-K and 20-F, we 
estimate that the proposed rule and form amendments would add 5 burden 
hours to the total burden hours required to produce each Form 40-F 
annual report.
5. Form 10-Q
    Based on a review of companies filing under certain SICs, as well 
as a review of companies that are currently providing disclosure of 
mine safety violations in Commission filings in accordance with Section 
1503 of the Act, we estimate that, of the 32,462 Form 10-Qs filed 
annually, approximately 285 are filed by companies that operate, or 
have a subsidiary that operates, a mine subject to the Mine Act, and 
that therefore would be affected by the proposed rule and form 
amendments.\94\ For purposes of the PRA, we assume that each such filer 
would have disclosures about mine safety violations to include in each 
Form 10-Q. We further estimate that the proposed rule and form 
amendments would add 5 burden hours to the total burden hours required 
to produce each Form 10-Q.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \94\ We estimate that approximately 95 companies with a Form 10-
Q filing obligation would be affected by the proposed rule and form 
amendments. Each such company would file three quarterly reports on 
Form 10-Q per year. 95 companies x 3 Forms 10-Q per year = 285 Forms 
10-Q.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Form 8-K
    We estimate that companies annually file 115,795 Form 8-Ks. Only 
companies that are operators, or have subsidiaries that are operators, 
of coal or other mines (as defined in the Mine Act, and subject to the 
Mine Act) are required to comply with the proposed new Form 8-K 
requirement. For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that there will be 
approximately 95 Form 8-K filers under new Item 1.04, which is based on 
our estimate of the number of Form 10-K filers that operate, or have a 
subsidiary that operates, a mine subject to the Mine Act, and that 
therefore would be affected by the proposed rule and form amendments. 
In addition, we understand that the triggering events for Form 8-K 
filing set forth in Section 1503(b)(2)--the receipt of written notice 
from MSHA that the coal or other mine has a pattern of violations or 
the potential to have such a pattern--are very rare, while the 
triggering event set forth in Section 1503(b)(1)--the receipt of an 
imminent danger order--is more common.\95\ For purposes of this 
calculation, we assume that each potential filer under proposed Item 
1.04 of Form 8-K would file three Forms 8-K per year under new Item 
1.04 and we estimate that the proposed amendments to Form 8-K would add 
1 burden hour to the total burden hours required to produce each Form 
8-K.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \95\ See U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General, 
In 32 Years MSHA Has Never Successfully Exercised Its Pattern of 
Violations Authority, Report Number 05-10-005-06-001 (Sept. 29, 
2010). According to data available on MSHA's website, 631 and 562 
imminent danger orders under Section 107(a) were issued during 
fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Violations Data Set (as of 
Nov. 12, 2010), available at <a href="http://www.msha.gov/OpenGovernmentData/OGIMSHA.asp">http://www.msha.gov/OpenGovernmentData/OGIMSHA.asp</a> (on file with the Division of Corporation Finance). Note 
that this number includes all imminent danger orders issued to all 
companies subject to MSHA's jurisdiction, not only to reporting 
companies that are subject to the disclosure requirements of Section 
1503 of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Summary of Proposed Changes to Annual Compliance Burden in 
Collection of Information

    The table below illustrates the total incremental annual compliance 
burden of the collection of information in hours and in cost under the 
proposed amendments for annual reports, quarterly reports and current 
reports on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act (Table 1). There is no 
change to the estimated burden of the collection of information under 
Regulation S-K because the burdens that Regulation S-K imposes are 
reflected in our revised estimates for the forms. The burden estimates 
were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of annual responses 
by the estimated average number of hours it would take a company to 
prepare and review the proposed disclosure requirements.

V. Cost-Benefit Analysis

A. Introduction and Objectives of Proposals

    We are proposing the rule and form amendments discussed in this 
release to implement the disclosure requirements set forth in Section 
1503 of the Act and to require limited additional disclosure to provide 
context for certain items required by that Section. Section 1503(a) of 
the Act requires issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary 
that is an operator, of a coal or other mine to disclose in their 
periodic reports filed with the Commission information regarding 
specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related 
assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities. Section 
1503(b) of the Act mandates the filing of a Form 8-K disclosing the 
receipt of certain orders and notices from the Mine Safety and Health 
Administration.
    As discussed in detail above, the disclosure requirements set forth 
in Section 1503 of the Act refer to and are based on the safety and 
health requirements applicable to mines under the Mine Act and 
administered by MSHA. MSHA inspectors issue citations, orders and 
decisions directly to mine operators during the course of inspections 
and MSHA assesses and collects civil monetary penalties for violations. 
Information on a mine-by-mine basis about inspections, violations, and 
accidents is publicly available on MSHA's data retrieval system on its 
Web site.\96\ Therefore, we believe the information required to be 
disclosed under Section 1503 of the Act and our proposed rules is 
readily available to issuers. Further, because the disclosure 
requirements set forth in Section 1503 are currently in effect, we 
assume that issuers have already begun to develop the necessary 
controls and procedures to review and prepare the information required 
by Section 1503 of the Act for filing with the Commission, such that 
the additional incremental disclosure we are proposing to provide 
context for certain items required by that Section will not require 
issuers to implement additional controls and procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \96\ See <a href="http://www.msha.gov/DRS/DRSHOME.HTM">http://www.msha.gov/DRS/DRSHOME.HTM</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are proposing amendments to Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 20-F and 
Form 40-F to provide for the disclosure required by Section 1503(a) of 
the Act and certain additional disclosures. New Item 106 of Regulation 
S-K, new Item 16J of Form 20-F and new Paragraph (18) of General 
Instruction B of Form 40-F would detail the information to be disclosed 
in accordance with Section 1503(a) of the Act, and the proposed 
amendment to Item 601 of Regulation S-K would set forth the exhibit 
requirement for Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the information required to 
be disclosed under proposed Item 106 of Regulation S-K. We are also 
proposing amendments to Form 8-K to add new Item 1.04 to implement the 
requirement imposed by Section 1503(b) of the Act. Finally, we propose 
to amend General Instruction I.A.3.(b) of Form S-3 to add new Form 8-K 
Item 1.04 to the list of Form 8-K items the untimely filing of which 
will not result in loss of Form S-3 eligibility.
    The Commission is sensitive to the costs and benefits that would be 
imposed by the proposed rule and form amendments. The discussion below 
focuses on the costs and benefits of the decisions made by the 
Commission to fulfill the mandates of the Act, rather than the cost and 
benefits of the mandates of the Act itself. However, to the extent that 
the Commission helps achieve the benefits intended by the Act, the two 
types of benefits are not entirely separable.

B. Benefits

    The proposed rulemaking is intended to implement the requirements 
of Section 1503 of the Act. Our proposed Regulation S-K and form 
amendments would implement the requirements of the Act by reiterating 
the disclosure items listed in Section 1503, which are currently in 
effect. We are also proposing to require limited additional disclosure 
in periodic reports addressing:
    <bullet> Brief descriptions of the categories of violations, orders 
or citations disclosed in response to the Section 1503(a) disclosure 
requirement;
    <bullet> Total dollar values of proposed penalty assessments from 
MSHA; and
    <bullet> Descriptions of legal actions pending before the FMSHRC 
and developments material to previously reported pending legal actions.

In addition, our proposed amendment to Form 8-K would require 
additional disclosure beyond that specifically designated by Section 
1503(b) of the Act by specifying the information required about the 
orders or notices required to be disclosed, and specifying a four 
business day filing deadline for Forms 8-K filed under proposed Item 
1.04.
    We believe the enhanced disclosures in periodic reports about the 
categories of violations will improve the ability of investors to 
understand the statutorily required information about mine safety 
violations without having extensive knowledge of the Mine Act and the 
violations, orders and citations referenced therein. We believe that 
investors would also benefit from the proposed disclosure in periodic 
reports of the total dollar value of the assessments and the 
description of legal actions and developments relating to legal actions 
because it would place the required disclosures in context.
    Our proposed amendment to Form 8-K specifying that the form is to 
be filed within four business days of receipt of the order or notice 
designated under Section 1503(b) of the Act would provide issuers and 
investors with certainty about the timing of that disclosure 
requirement.
    Our proposed rule and form amendments also specify for issuers how, 
in what form, and when to report the mine safety information required 
by the Act. These rules are designed to facilitate compliance with the 
new statutory requirements.

C. Costs

    The vast majority of the costs resulting from the disclosures 
required by Section 1503 of the Act arise whether or not we adopt rules 
to implement the Section. Moreover, the information required to be 
disclosed under Section 1503 is already subject to an extensive 
recordkeeping regime under MSHA and is readily available to issuers via 
MSHA's data retrieval system. The primary costs to result from this 
rulemaking are costs associated with the formatting and filing of the 
information and certain additional disclosures we are proposing: the 
description of the incidents, total dollar value of the proposed 
penalty assessments and the description of legal actions, as noted 
above. Given that this information

[[Page 80386]]

should be readily available to issuers and the additional information 
does not require a substantial amount of additional disclosure, we 
believe that these costs would be small.\97\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \97\ For purposes of the PRA, we estimate the total cost of the 
disclosure to be approximately 1,677 hours of company personnel time 
and approximately $263,500 for the services of outside 
professionals. However, this amount includes the costs associated 
with the disclosure requirement of Section 1503 of the Act, as well 
as our proposed additional disclosure. As discussed above, the 
proposed additional disclosure is only a small portion of the burden 
of the disclosure requirement; therefore, we believe the costs of 
the additional disclosure would be a small fraction of the total 
amount disclosed for PRA purposes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Request for Comment

    We request data to quantify the costs and the value of the benefits 
described above. We seek estimates of these costs and benefits, as well 
as any costs and benefits not already defined, that may result from the 
adoption of these proposed amendments. We also request qualitative 
feedback on the nature of the benefits and costs described above and 
any benefits and costs we may have overlooked.

VI. Consideration of Impact on the Economy, Burden on Competition and 
Promotion of Efficiency, Competition and Capital Formation

    Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act \98\ requires us, when 
adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact that any 
new rule would have on competition. In addition, Section 23(a)(2) 
prohibits us from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on 
competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes 
of the Exchange Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \98\ 15 U.S.C. 78w(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 2(b) \99\ of the Securities Act and Section 3(f) \100\ of 
the Exchange Act require us, when engaging in rulemaking where we are 
required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the 
protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, 
competition, and capital formation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \99\ 15 U.S.C. 77b(b).
    \100\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our proposed amendments would implement the requirements of Section 
1503 of the Act. We have proposed a few additional disclosure 
requirements to provide investors with context for the information 
required to be disclosed under Section 1503. We believe the additional 
disclosure will improve the ability of investors to understand the 
statutorily required information about mine safety violations without 
having extensive knowledge of the Mine Act and the orders, citations 
and violations referenced therein.
    We do not believe that the additional disclosure we have proposed 
in our rulemaking would impose a burden on competition. Section 1503 of 
the Act imposed the substance of the disclosure requirements set forth 
in our proposals. The additional disclosure that we have proposed to 
require is not substantial, but rather brief descriptions to place the 
mine safety disclosures in context. In addition, we believe the 
additional information should be readily available to issuers. 
Accordingly, since the additional disclosure is designed to provide 
context to the information required to be disclosed by Section 1503 of 
the Act, and does not place a significant burden on the issuer, we 
believe that it will not impose a burden on competition. Likewise, we 
do not expect that the additional disclosure we are proposing to 
require would have a significant impact on capital formation.
    We believe that the proposed clarifications to the mine safety 
information required by the Act will provide direction and consistency 
as to how, in what form, and when to report the relevant information. 
We believe that the specifications in the rulemaking will improve the 
efficiency of the reporting process for issuers and provide for a more 
efficient and effective review of the information by investors.
    The loss of eligibility by an issuer to use Form S-3 could 
significantly restrict the ability of a company to raise capital and 
may be a disproportionately large negative consequence of an untimely 
filing of a Form 8-K. To address this potential burden on capital 
formation, we are proposing to revise the eligibility rules under Form 
S-3 so that an untimely filing of a report under new Item 1.04 of Form 
8-K would not result in a loss of eligibility to use that form.
    We request comment on whether the proposed amendments would promote 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation or have an impact or 
burden on competition. Commentators are requested to provide empirical 
data and other factual support for their view to the extent possible.

VII. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act

    For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness 
Act of 1996 (SBREFA) \101\ we solicit data to determine whether the 
proposed rule amendments constitute a ``major'' rule. Under SBREFA, a 
rule is considered ``major'' where, if adopted, it results or is likely 
to result in:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \101\ 5 U.S.C. 603.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more 
(either in the form of an increase or a decrease);
    <bullet> A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or 
individual industries; or
    <bullet> Significant adverse effects on competition, investment or 
innovation.
    Commentators should provide empirical data on (a) the potential 
annual effect on the economy; (b) any increase in costs or prices for 
consumers or individual industries; and (c) any potential effect on 
competition, investment or innovation.

VIII. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis

    This Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in 
accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\102\ It relates to 
proposed revisions to Regulation S-K and forms under the Securities Act 
and the Exchange Act regarding disclosure about mine safety.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \102\ 5 U.S.C. 601.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Action

    We are proposing rulemaking to implement the disclosure 
requirements set forth in Section 1503 of the Act and to require 
limited additional disclosure to provide context for certain items 
required by the Act. Section 1503(a) of the Act requires issuers that 
are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal 
or other mine to disclose in their periodic reports filed with the 
Commission information regarding specified health and safety 
violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal 
actions, and mining-related fatalities. Section 1503(b) of the Act 
mandates the filing of a Form 8-K disclosing the receipt of certain 
orders and notices from MSHA.

B. Legal Basis

    We are proposing the amendments pursuant to Sections 7, 10, and 
19(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 12, 13, 15 and 23 of the Exchange 
Act, and Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act.

C. Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Action

    The proposed amendments would affect some companies that are small 
entities. The Regulatory Flexibility Act defines ``small entity'' to 
mean ``small business,'' ``small organization,'' or ``small 
governmental jurisdiction.'' \103\

[[Page 80387]]

The Commission's rules define ``small business'' and ``small 
organization'' for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act for each 
of the types of entities regulated by the Commission. Securities Act 
Rule 157 \104\ and Exchange Act Rule 0-10(a) \105\ define a company, 
other than an investment company, to be a ``small business'' or ``small 
organization'' if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last 
day of its most recent fiscal year. We believe that our proposals would 
affect small entities that (i) are required to file reports under 
Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and (ii) operate, or have a 
subsidiary that operates, a coal or other mine, and therefore are 
required to provide mine safety disclosure under Section 1503 of the 
Act. We estimate that there are approximately 25 companies that would 
currently be required to provide the Section 1503 disclosure and that 
may be considered small entities. We note that there are a significant 
number of small entities that are exploration stage mining companies 
that would be required to provide the Section 1503 disclosure if such 
companies were to become operators, or have subsidiaries that become 
operators, of coal or other mines subject to the Mine Act.

    \105\ 17 CFR 240.0-10(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements

    The disclosure requirements we are proposing today are intended to 
implement the disclosure requirements set forth in Section 1503 of the 
Act and to require additional disclosure to provide context for certain 
items required by the Act. These amendments would require small 
entities that are required to file reports under Sections 13(a) or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act and operate, or have a subsidiary that 
operates, a coal or other mine to provide mine safety disclosure under 
applicable rules and forms.
    Small entities would be required to include the disclosure in their 
annual report on Form 10-K, Form 20-F or Form 40-F and, if applicable, 
quarterly report on Form 10-Q and current report on Form 8-K. We are 
proposing amendments to Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 20-F and Form 40-F 
to require the disclosure required by Section 1503(a) of the Act and 
certain additional disclosures. New Item 106 of Regulation S-K, new 
Item 16J of Form 20-F and new Paragraph (18) of General Instruction B 
of Form 40-F would detail the information to be disclosed in accordance 
with Section 1503(a) of the Act, and the proposed amendment to Item 601 
of Regulation S-K would set forth the exhibit requirement for Form 10-K 
and Form 10-Q for the information required to be disclosed under 
proposed Item 106 of Regulation S-K. We are also proposing amendments 
to Form 8-K to add new Item 1.04 to implement the requirement imposed 
by Section 1503(b) of the Act. Finally, we propose to amend General 
Instruction I.A.3.(b) of Form S-3 to add new Form 8-K Item 1.04 to the 
list of Form 8-K items the untimely filing of which will not result in 
loss of Form S-3 eligibility.

E. Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting Federal Rules

    Section 1503 of the Act imposed the disclosure requirements set 
forth in Sections 1503(a) and (b) of the Act, regardless of whether the 
Commission adopts rules to implement those provisions. Our proposed 
amendments incorporate the Act's requirements into Regulation S-K and 
related forms. The disclosure requirement of Section 1503(a)(1)(G) of 
the Act, which requires disclosure of mining-related fatalities, 
overlaps to some extent with a disclosure requirement under MSHA rules. 
MSHA requires companies to report immediately any death of an 
individual at a mine,\106\ which MSHA then makes available to the 
public through its data retrieval system on its Web site, <a href="http://www.msha.gov">http://www.msha.gov</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \106\ See 30 CFR 50.10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

F. Significant Alternatives

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs us to consider alternatives 
that would accomplish our stated objectives, while minimizing any 
significant adverse impact on small entities. In connection with the 
proposed disclosure amendments, we considered the following 
alternatives:
    (1) Establishing differing compliance or reporting requirements or 
timetables which take into account the resources available to smaller 
entities;
    (2) Exempting smaller entities from coverage of the disclosure 
requirements, or any part thereof;
    (3) The clarification, consolidation, or simplification of 
disclosure for small entities; and
    (4) Use of performance standards rather than design standards.
    Section 1503 of the Act requires all entities, including small 
entities, that are required to file reports under Sections 13(a) or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act and operate, or have a subsidiary that 
operates, a coal or other mine to provide mine safety disclosure under 
applicable rules and forms. These requirements apply without regard to 
whether we adopt rules to implement them. The proposed amendments 
implement the disclosure requirements set forth in Section 1503 of the 
Act, and require additional disclosure to provide context for certain 
items required by the Act. Given the statutory disclosure requirements 
in Section 1503 of the Act, the Act does not appear to contemplate 
separate compliance or reporting requirements for smaller entities. We 
nevertheless solicit comment on the propriety of a complete or partial 
exemption from the requirements for smaller entities.
    Our proposed amendments would require clear and straightforward 
disclosure of the information required by Section 1503 of the Act. We 
have used design rather than performance standards in connection with 
the proposed amendments. By specifying in the Act the disclosure 
required, Congress appears to have contemplated that consistent, 
comparable disclosure would be provided. We believe that the specific 
disclosure requirements in the proposed amendments would promote 
consistent and comparable disclosure among all companies that operate, 
or have a subsidiary that operates, a coal or other mine. Further, 
based on our past experience, we believe that specific disclosure 
requirements for this information would be more useful to investors 
than would a performance standard.
    Currently, small entities are subject to some different compliance 
or reporting requirements under Regulation S-K and the proposed 
amendments would not affect these requirements. The proposed disclosure 
requirements would apply to small entities to the same extent as larger 
issuers. We do not believe these disclosures will create a significant 
new burden, and we believe this approach is consistent with the 
requirements of the Act.

G. Solicitation of Comments

    We encourage the submission of comments with respect to any aspect 
of this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. In particular, we 
request comments regarding:
    <bullet> How the proposed amendments can achieve their objective 
while lowering the burden on small entities;
    <bullet> The number of small entities that may be affected by the 
proposed amendments;
    <bullet> The existence or nature of the potential impact of the 
proposed amendments on small entities discussed in the analysis; and
    <bullet> How to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments.

[[Page 80388]]

    Respondents are asked to describe the nature of any impact and 
provide empirical data supporting the extent of the impact. Such 
comments will be considered in the preparation of the Final Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis, if the proposed rule amendments are adopted, and 
will be placed in the same public file as comments on the proposed 
amendments themselves.

subsidiary of the registrant is an operator, that receive written 
notice from the Mine Safety and Health Administration of:
    (i) A pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards 
that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially 
contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other mine health or
