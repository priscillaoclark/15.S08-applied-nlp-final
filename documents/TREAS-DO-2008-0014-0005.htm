Extension of Import Restrictions Imposed on Archaeological 
Material From Cambodia

AGENCIES: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland 
Security; Department of the Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document amends Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
regulations to reflect both continuing and new import restrictions on 
certain archaeological material from Cambodia. Import restrictions that 
were previously imposed by CBP Decision 03-28 on certain stone, metal, 
and ceramic archaeological materials that are due to expire on 
September 19, 2008, are extended. The Assistant Secretary for 
Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, 
has made the requisite determination for the extension of import 
restrictions that previously existed and for amending the agreement so 
that it applies also to archaeological material of the Bronze and Iron 
Ages. Accordingly, these import restrictions will remain in effect 
until September 19, 2013, and title 19 of the CBP regulations is being 
amended to reflect this amended bilateral agreement. These restrictions 
are being extended pursuant to determinations of the United States 
Department of State made under the terms of the 1970 Convention on 
Cultural Property Implementation Act in accordance with the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit 
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. This 
document also contains the amended Designated List of Archaeological 
Material that describes the articles to which the restrictions apply, 
including the new categories of objects (glass and bone) and the 
additional subcategories of stone and metal objects from the Bronze and 
Iron Age.

DATES: Effective Date: This final rule is effective on September 19, 
2008.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    Pursuant to the provisions of the 1970 United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention, codified into 
U.S. law as the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act 
(Pub. L. 97-446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.), the United States entered 
into a bilateral agreement with Cambodia on September 19, 2003, 
concerning the imposition of import restrictions on Khmer 
archaeological material from the 6th century through the 16th century 
A.D. in Cambodia. On September 22, 2003, CBP published CBP Decision 03-
28 in the Federal Register (68 FR 55000), which amended 19 CFR 
12.104g(a) to reflect the imposition of these restrictions, which 
subsumed the emergency import restrictions of 1999, and included a list 
designating the types of archaeological material covered by the 
restrictions.
    Import restrictions listed in 19 CFR 12.104g(a) are ``effective for 
no more than five years beginning on the date on which the agreement 
enters into force with respect to the United States. This period can be 
extended for additional periods not to exceed five years if it is 
determined that the factors which justified the initial agreement still 
pertain and no cause for suspension of the agreement exists'' (19 CFR 
12.104g(a)).

Amended Bilateral Agreement

    Consistent with expressed interest in an extension of the agreement 
from the Royal Government of Cambodia and with the findings and 
recommendations of the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, the 
Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States 
Department of State, made the requisite determinations on June 13, 
2008, that the cultural heritage of Cambodia continues to be in 
jeopardy from the pillage of the archaeological materials described 
further below in the list of designated materials, and that, therefore, 
the import restrictions on certain stone archaeological materials from 
Cambodia that were previously imposed by emergency import restrictions 
under Treasury Decision (T.D.) 99-88 (64 FR 67479, December 2, 1999) 
and then extended by CBP Decision 03-28 (68 FR 55000, September 22, 
2003) to include certain stone, metal, and ceramic archaeological 
materials, are extended for an additional five year period until 
September 19, 2013, and include additional subcategories of objects and 
new categories of glass and bone objects from the Bronze and Iron Age. 
Accordingly, the title of the bilateral agreement was amended to read: 
``Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the United 
States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia 
Concerning the Imposition of Import Restrictions on Archaeological 
Material from Cambodia from the Bronze Age through the Khmer Era.''
    By exchange of diplomatic notes the agreement was extended and 
amended on August 26, 2008. Accordingly, CBP is amending 19 CFR 
12.104g(a) to reflect the extension of the import restrictions on the 
currently protected cultural property as well as the new categories and 
subcategories from the Bronze Age (c. 1500 B.C.-500 B.C.) and the Iron 
Age (c. 500 B.C.-550 A.D.) in the amended bilateral agreement.

Amended Designated List

    The Designated List of articles that are protected pursuant to the 
bilateral agreement, as amended, on Archaeological Material from 
Cambodia from the Bronze Age (c. 1500 B.C.) through the sixteenth 
century (16th c. A.D.) has been revised. We note that subcategories of 
objects from the Bronze and Iron Ages have been added, as well as new 
categories, such as glass and bone, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2606.

List of Archaeological Material From Cambodia From the Bronze Age (c. 
1500 B.C.) Through the 16th Century A.D.

    Restricted archaeological material from Cambodia includes the 
categories listed below. The following list is representative only.

I. Stone

    This category consists largely of materials made of sandstone, 
including many color shades (grey to greenish to black, pink to red and 
violet, and some yellowish tones) and varying granulosity. Due to 
oxidation and iron content, the stone surface can become hard and take 
on a different color than the stone core. These surface colors range 
from yellowish to brownish to different shades of grey. This dense 
surface can be polished. Some statues and reliefs are coated with a 
kind of clear shellac or lacquer of different colors (black, red, gold, 
yellow, brown). The surface of sandstone pieces can also however be 
quite rough. Chipped surfaces can be white in color. In the absence of 
any systematic technical analysis of ancient Khmer stonework, no exact 
description of other stone types can be provided. It is clear however 
that other types of stone were also used (some volcanic rock, rhyolite, 
and schist, etc.), but these are nonetheless exceptional. Some quartz 
objects are also known. Precious and semi-precious stones were also 
used as applied decor or in jewelry settings.
    Different types of stone degradation can be noted. Eroded surfaces 
result from sanding (loss of surface grains), contour scaling 
(detachment of surface plaques along contour lines), flaking, and 
exfoliation. The stone can also split along sedimentation layers. 
Chipping or fragmentation of sculpted stone is also common.
    Stone objects included here come under several periods: Bronze Age 
(c. 1500 B.C.-500 B.C.), Iron Age (c. 500 B.C.-550 A.D.), pre-Angkorian 
(6th-9th c.), Angkorian (9th-14th c.), and post-Angkorian (14th-16th 
c.). Many stone objects can be firmly assigned to one of these periods; 
some, notably architectural elements and statues, can be further 
assigned a specific style and a more precise date within the given 
period.

A. Sculpture

1. Architectural Elements
    Stone was used for religious architecture in the pre-Angkorian and 
Angkorian periods. The majority of ancient Khmer temples were built 
almost entirely in stone. Even for those temples built primarily in 
brick, numerous decorative elements in stone were also employed. Only 
small portions of early post-Angkorian edifices were built in stone. 
The architectural elements that follow are therefore characteristic of 
pre-Angkorian and Angkorian times. The state of the material varies 
greatly, some objects being well preserved, others severely eroded or 
fragmented. The sculpture of some pieces remains unfinished.
    a. Pediments. Pediments are large decorative stone fixtures placed 
above temple doorways. They are triangular in shape and composed of two 
or more separate blocks that are fitted together and sculpted with 
decorative motifs. The ensemble can range from approximately 1-3 meters 
in width and 1-3 meters in height. Motifs include floral scrolls, 
medallions, human figures, and animals. A whole scene from a well-known 
story can also be represented.
    b. Lintels. Lintels are rectangular monoliths placed directly above 
temple entrance gates or doorways, below the pediments described above. 
They are decorated with motifs similar to those of pediments. They can 
reach up to nearly

[[Page 54311]]

one meter in height and one and one half meters in width.
    c. False doors. Three of the four doorways of a temple sanctuary 
are frequently ``false doors''; that is, though they are sculpted to 
look like doors, they do not open. They bear graphic and floral motifs, 
sometimes integrating human and animal figures. These doors can reach 
up to more than two meters in height and more than one meter in width. 
They can be monolithic or composed of separate blocks fitted together.
    d. Columnettes. Columnettes are decorative columns placed on either 
side of a temple door entrance. They can be sculpted in deep relief out 
of a temple doorway and therefore remain attached to the doorway on 
their back side. The earliest columnettes are round and sculpted with 
bands which themselves are sculpted with decorative motifs. Later in 
the Angkorian period, the columnettes are octagonal in shape and bear 
more complex and abundant sculpted decor on the concentric bands. This 
decor includes graphic designs (pearls, diamond shapes, flowers, etc.) 
repeated at regular intervals along the length of the column. The base 
of the column is square and is also sculpted with diverse motifs and 
figures. The columnettes can reach around 25 cm. in diameter and more 
than two meters in height.
    e. Pilasters. Pilasters are decorative rectangular supports 
projecting partially from the wall on either side of a temple doorway. 
They are treated architecturally as columns with base, shaft, and 
capital. Motifs include floral scrolls and graphic designs of pearls, 
diamond shapes, etc., as well as human or animal figures. They range in 
width from approximately 20-30 cm. and can reach a height of more than 
two meters.
    f. Antefixes. Antefixes are decorative elements placed around the 
exterior of each level of temple tower. They are small free-standing 
sculptures and can take multiple forms, including but not limited to 
graphic designs, animal figures, human figures in niches, and miniature 
models of temples.
    g. Balustrade finials. Long balustrades in the form of mythical 
serpents are found in many Angkorian temples. Often, these line either 
side of the entrance causeways to temples. The ends of the balustrade 
take the form of the serpent's multiple cobra-like heads.
    h. Wall reliefs. Much of the surface area of most temples is 
sculpted with decorative reliefs. This decor includes graphic designs 
and floral motifs as well as human or animal figures. The figures can 
range in size from just a few centimeters to more than one meter in 
height. They can be integrated into the decor or set off in niches. 
Narrative scenes can also be represented.
    i. Other decorative items. Other decorative items include wall 
spikes, roof tile finials, sculpted steps, and other architectural 
decorations.
2. Free-Standing Sculpture
    The pre-Angkorian and Angkorian periods are characterized by 
extensive production of statuary in stone. Some stone statuary was also 
produced during the post-Angkorian period. This statuary is relatively 
diverse, including human figures ranging from less than one half meter 
to nearly three meters in height, as well as animal figures. Some 
figures, representations of Indian gods, have multiple arms and heads. 
Figures can be represented alone or in groups of two or three. When 
male and female figures are presented together as an ensemble, the 
female figures are disproportionately smaller than their male 
counterparts. Some are part-human, part-animal. Figures can be 
standing, sitting, or riding animal mounts. Many figures are 
represented wearing crowns or special headdresses and holding 
attributes such as a baton or a conch shell. Clothing and sometimes 
jewelry are sculpted into the body. Though statues are generally 
monolithic, later post-Angkorian statues of Buddha can have separate 
arms sculpted in wood and attached to the stone body. Many statues were 
once lacquered in black, dark brown, red, or gold colors and retain 
lacquer traces. Some yellow lacquer is also found.
    a. Human and hybrid (part-human, part-animal) figures. Examples 
include statues of the eight-armed god and the four-armed god, 
representations of Buddha in various attitudes or stances, and female 
and male figures or deities, including parts (heads, hands, crowns, or 
decorative elements) of statuary and groups of figures.
    b. Animal figures. Examples include bulls, elephants, lions, and 
small mammals such as squirrels.
    c. Votive objects. A number of more abstract sculptures were also 
the object of religious representation from pre-Angkorian to post-
Angkorian times. Examples include ritual phallic symbols and sculpted 
footprints of Buddha.
    d. Pedestals. Pedestals for statues can be square, rectangular, or 
round. They vary greatly in size and can be decorated with graphic and 
floral decor, as well as animal or human figures. They are usually made 
of numerous components fitted together, including a base and a top 
section into which the statue is set.
    e. Foundation deposit stones. Sacred deposits were placed under 
statues, as well as under temple foundations and in temple roof vaults, 
from pre-Angkorian to post-Angkorian times. Marks on these stones 
indicate sacred configurations, which could contain deposits such as 
gold or precious stones.
3. Stelae
    a. Sculpted stelae. Free-standing stelae, sculpted with shallow or 
deep reliefs, served as objects of worship and sometimes as boundary 
stones from pre-Angkorian to post-Angkorian times. Examples include 
stelae with relief images of gods and goddesses, Buddhas, figures in 
niches, and other symbols.
    b. Inscriptions. Texts recording temple foundations or other 
information were inscribed on stone stelae from pre-Angkorian to post-
Angkorian times. Such texts can also be found on temple doorjambs, 
pillars, and walls. The stelae are found in a number of different 
shapes and sizes and can also bear decorative reliefs, for example a 
bull seated on a lotus flower.
4. Sculpture in Brick
    Brick was used mainly in pre-Angkorian and some relatively early 
Angkorian religious architecture. Yet, typically, while the bodies of 
buildings were in brick, some of the decorative elements listed above-
pediments, lintels, etc.-were in stone. The brick, of light orange 
color, was usually sculpted with a preliminary relief, which was then 
covered over with white stucco, itself sculpted along brick contours. 
Some brick reliefs seem however to have been fully sculpted and not 
meant to be covered in stucco. Brick temple reliefs include graphic 
design, as well as floral or animal decor. Human and animal figures can 
also be represented.

B. Jewelry

    In the Bronze and Iron Ages, beads were made from semi-precious 
stones such as agate and carnelian. Agate beads are banded stone, black 
to light brown to white in their bands. These are usually carved into 
tubular shapes. Carnelian beads are reddish orange and glassy. These 
are usually ball-shaped. Bronze and Iron Age stone bracelets have 
triangular or rectangular cross-sections.

C. Chipped and Ground Tools

    During the Bronze and Iron Ages, chipped and ground tools such as 
adzes, whetstones, and arrowheads were made of metamorphic rock.

II. Metal

    This category consists mainly of bronze objects. No singular alloy 
is characteristic of Cambodian bronzes, which contain varying degrees 
of

[[Page 54312]]

copper, zinc, lead, and iron. Surface colors can range from dark to 
light brown to goldish; a green patina is found on many objects. Some 
bronzes are also gilt. Some artwork in silver and gold also survives 
but is much less common.
    Most objects were cast with the ``lost wax'' technique, by which a 
mold of the object is built around a full or hollow wax model; the wax 
is then melted out with hot metal, which then hardens in the mold. 
Because the mold must be destroyed to obtain the metal object, each 
casting is unique. Decor can be chiseled into the finished metal 
surface. As early as the Bronze and Iron Ages, objects demonstrate a 
very high degree of technical skill. The ``repousse'' technique, by 
which metal is beaten into shape in a concave mold, was also used.
    Most of the objects presented here can be assigned to one of the 
periods defined for stone objects above: Bronze Age (c. 1500 B.C.-500 
B.C.), Iron Age (c. 500 B.C.-550 A.D.), pre-Angkorian (6th-9th c.), 
Angkorian (9th-14th c.), and post-Angkorian (14th-16th c.). Some 
pieces, in particular statuary and ritual or domestic accessories with 
motifs akin to architectural decor in stone, can also be assigned to 
specific styles and corresponding time periods within the larger 
historical periods.

A. Statues and Statuettes

    Khmer metal statuary is comparable to Khmer stone statuary in both 
thematic and stylistic treatment. (See general description of free-
standing sculpture above.) Statues can be represented alone or in 
groups ranging from human figures on animal mounts to triads, to more 
complex ensembles including architectural structures and decor. Though 
some colossal statues are known in both pre-Angkorian and Angkorian 
times, metal statues are, generally, relatively smaller in scale than 
their stone counterparts. Colossal statues can reach more than two 
meters in height; fragments demonstrate that one reclining figure 
measured some six meters in length. Such colossal pieces are 
nonetheless rare.
    Statuettes as small around as 15 cm. are common; larger statues 
more typically reach around one meter in height. Small-scale statues 
are generally composed of a single cast; separate pieces however can be 
placed together, for example on a single pedestal, to form an ensemble. 
Larger works can be composed of multiple pieces fitted together with 
joints which can be concealed by chiseled decor. Only some small 
statuettes are solid. Others are composed of two plaques, one for the 
front of the piece and the other for the back; the plaques are filled 
with a resin-or tar-based substance and soldered together. Larger 
pieces are hollow. It should be noted that the Bayon period (late 12th-
early 13th c.) has left more bronze statuary than any other period.
    Post-Angkorian bronze statues and statuettes, like their stone 
counterparts, take on certain characteristics of Siamese sculpture but 
can nonetheless usually be identified as Khmer due to certain types of 
decor and bodily form which maintain or develop on a specific Angkorian 
tradition.
    1. Human and Hybrid (Part-human, Part-animal) Figures. Examples 
include standing male figures, Buddhas, four-armed male figures, female 
figures, gods, and goddesses, all in various attitudes and dress, 
including fragments of sculpture such as hands, arms, and heads.
    2. Animal Figures. Animal representations in bronze resemble those 
in stone in both thematic and stylistic treatment. Statues and 
statuettes include primarily bulls, lions, and elephants with one or 
three trunks. Other animals, such as horses, are also represented but 
are less common. The only colossal animal images known date to the late 
12th-early 13th c. Other animal figures, such as the mythical 
multiheaded serpent and mythical birds and monkeys, are also frequently 
found as decor of ritual or domestic objects.
    3. Pedestals. Pedestals in bronze often appear to be simplified and 
reduced versions of their stone counterparts. One innovation of 
sculpting the base in openwork is to be noted.

B. Other Ritual and Domestic Objects

    1. Special Objects Used in Ritual. Special ritual objects include 
bells, conch shells, and musical instruments such as tambourines, etc.
    2. Containers. Ritual and domestic containers include such items as 
perfume holders, oil lamps or bowls, and boxes with decorative or 
sculptural features.
    3. Decorative Elements from Ritual or Domestic Objects. In addition 
to the decorative accessory items noted below, there exist insignia 
finials for banner poles which often take the form of small human or 
animal figures.
    4. Jewelry. Jewelry, including but not limited to rings, bracelets, 
arm bands, necklaces, and belts, could have been worn not only by 
people but also by statues. Bronze and Iron Age bracelets may be 
decorated with scrolls, spirals, and the heads of buffalo/cows. 
Different types of rings can be noted: Ring-stamps, rings with 
ornamental settings, rings with settings in the form of a bull or other 
animal, and rings with settings for stones.
    5. Musical Instruments. Diverse percussion instruments, including 
varying sizes of bells, drums, gongs, and cymbals, were made in bronze. 
These may carry geometric designs and/or images of humans and animals.
    6. Animal Fittings. In addition to bells to be suspended around the 
necks of animals, common to both the Angkorian and the post-Angkorian 
periods, various kinds of decorative animal harness accessories are 
known in post-Angkorian times.

C. Architectural Elements

    Metal architectural elements include ceiling or wall plaques 
sculpted with flowers or other motifs, floral plaques, and panels.

D. Weapons and Tools

    Metal weapons and tools include arrow heads, daggers, spear tips, 
swords, helmets, axes, adzes, chisels, spoons, and sickles.

III. Ceramics

    Bronze and Iron Age ceramics are primarily earthenwares with 
varying colors and surface treatments. Later ceramics include both 
glazed and unglazed stonewares. Stonewares, and particularly glazed 
wares, are characteristic of the Angkorian period (9th-14th c.). Khmer 
ceramics production primarily concerned functional vessels (vases, 
pots, etc.) but also included sculpture of figurines and architectural 
or other decorative elements. Angkorian period vessels were generally 
turned on a wheel and fired in kilns. Vessels range in size from around 
five to at least 70 cm. in height. Glaze colors are fairly limited and 
include creamy white, pale green (color of Chinese tea), straw-yellow, 
reddish-brown, brown, olive, and black. Light colors are generally 
glossy, while darker colors can be glossy or matte. Some two-colored 
wares, primarily combining pale green and brown, are also known. 
Decoration is relatively subtle, limited to incisions of graphic 
designs (criss-crosses, striations, waves, etc.), some sculpted decor 
such as lotus petal shapes, and molding (ridges, grooves, etc.); some 
applied work is also seen. Most decoration is found on shoulders and 
necks, as on lids; footed vessels are typically beveled at the base. 
Many wasters (imperfect pieces) are found and are also subject to 
illicit trade.

A. Sculpture

    Ceramic sculpture known to have been produced in Cambodia proper 
largely concerns architectural elements.

[[Page 54313]]

Though some figurines are known and are of notable refinement, statuary 
and reliefs in ceramics seem to be more characteristic of provincial 
production.
    1. Architectural Elements. Some pre-Angkorian, Angkorian, and post-
Angkorian period buildings, primarily but not exclusively royal or 
upper-class habitation, were roofed with ceramic tiles. The tiles 
include undecorated flat tiles and convex and concave pieces fitted 
together; a sculpted tile was placed as a decor at the end of each row 
of tiles. These pieces were produced in molds and can be unglazed or 
glazed. The unglazed pieces are orange in color; the glazed pieces are 
creamy white to pale green. Spikes placed at the crest of roof vaults 
can also be made in ceramics. These spikes were fit into a cylinder, 
also made of ceramics, which was itself fitted into the roof vault. 
Architectural ceramics sometimes have human heads and anthropomorphic 
or zoomorphic features.
    2. Figurines and Ritual Objects. Figurines, statuettes, or plaques 
can include human, hybrid (part-human, part-animal), and animal 
figures. These are typically small in size (around 10 cm.). Ritual 
objects found in Cambodia proper are limited primarily to pieces in the 
shape of a conch shell, used for pouring sacral water or as blowing 
horns.

B. Vessels

    1. Lidded Containers. Examples include round lidded boxes with 
incised or sculpted decoration, bulbous vases with lids, and jars with 
conical multi-tiered lids. Lids themselves include conical shapes and 
convex lids with knobs.
    2. Lenticular Pots. Pots of depressed globular form are commonly 
referred to as lenticular pots. The mouth of the vessel is closed with 
a stopper.
    3. Animal-shaped Pots. The depressed globular form can take animal 
shapes, with applied animal head, tail, or other body parts that can 
serve as handles. The animal-shaped pot is also found in other forms. 
Animal-shaped pots often contain remains of white lime, a substance 
used in betel nut chewing. Shapes include bulls, elephants, birds, 
horses, and other four-legged creatures.
    4. Human-shaped Pots. Anthropomorphic vessels often have some 
applied and incised decoration representing human appendages, features, 
or clothing. The vessels are usually gourd-shaped bottles.
    5. Bottles. This category includes a number of different kinds of 
vessels with raised mouths.
    6. Vases. A number of different types of vases are grouped together 
under this general heading. Some are flat based and bulbous or conical. 
Others have pedestal feet. Some are characterized by their elongated 
necks. The ``baluster vases,'' for which Khmer ceramics are 
particularly known, have pedestal feet, conical bodies, relatively long 
necks, and flared mouths.
    7. Spouted Pots. These are vessels, usually in the ``baluster 
vase'' form, that have short pouring spouts attached to the shoulder. 
Some spouted pots also have ring handles on the opposite shoulder.
    8. Large Jars. Large barrel-shaped jars or vats have flat bases, 
wide mouths, short necks, and flattened everted rims. They are always 
iron glazed.
    9. Bowls. Bowls with broad, flat bases and flaring walls that are 
either straight or slightly concave, ending in plain everted or 
incurving rims, usually have green or yellowish glaze, although some 
brown-glazed bowls are known. Some are decorated with incised lines 
just below the rim. Most have deep flanges above the base; some are 
plain. Small hemispherical cups on button bases bear brown glaze. 
Another form is the bowl on a pedestal foot.

IV. Glass

    Bronze and Iron Age glass beads are usually very small (1-2 mm 
across) and come in a range of colors from blue, green, red and white. 
Other artifacts made of glass include spiral earrings and triangular 
bangle bracelets. The bracelets are light to dark green or blue-green 
and translucent.

V. Bone

    Bone (and sometimes ivory or horn) beads, bangles, pendants, and 
combs are found at Bronze and Iron Age sites.
    More information on import restrictions can be obtained from the 
International Cultural Property Protection Web site (<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop">http://
exchanges.state.gov/culprop</A>). The restrictions on the importation of 
these archaeological materials from Cambodia are to continue in effect 
for an additional 5 years. Importation of such materials continues to 
be restricted unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 19 
CFR 12.104c are met.

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public procedure 
(5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). For the same reason, a delayed effective date is 
not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply.

Executive Order 12866

    Because this rule involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States, it is not subject to Executive Order 12866.

Signing Authority

    This regulation is being issued in accordance with 19 CFR 
0.1(a)(1).
