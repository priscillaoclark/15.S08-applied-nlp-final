12. On page 56586, in Appendix H to Part 1002, in the first column, 
footnote 959 should read as follows:

    For a financial institution with fewer than 30 entries in its 
small business lending application register, the full sample size is 
the financial institution's total number of entries. The threshold 
number for such financial institutions remains three. Accordingly, 
the threshold percentage will be higher for financial institutions 
with fewer than 30 entries in their registers.
