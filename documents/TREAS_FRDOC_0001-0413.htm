SUMMARY: This final rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) regulations to reflect the imposition of import restrictions on 
certain categories of archaeological and ethnological material of the 
Republic of Albania (Albania). These restrictions are being imposed 
pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Albania that has 
been entered into under the authority of the Convention on Cultural 
Property Implementation Act. This final rule amends the CBP regulations 
by adding Albania to the list of countries which have a bilateral 
agreement with the United States that imposes cultural property import 
restrictions. This final rule also contains the Designated List that 
describes the types of archaeological and ethnological material to 
which the restrictions apply.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, Public Law 
97-446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. (hereinafter, ``the Cultural Property 
Implementation Act''), implements the 1970 United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on the Means 
of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer 
of Ownership of Cultural Property (hereinafter, ``the Convention'' (823 
U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)). Pursuant to the Cultural Property Implementation 
Act, the United States entered into a bilateral agreement with the 
Republic of Albania (Albania) to impose import restrictions on certain 
archaeological and ethnological material from Albania. This rule 
announces the imposition of import restrictions on certain 
archaeological and ethnological material from Albania.

Determinations

    Under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1), the United States must make certain 
determinations before entering into an agreement to impose import 
restrictions under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). On May 26, 2021, the Acting 
Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States 
Department of State, after consultation with and recommendation by the 
Cultural Property Advisory Committee, made the determinations required 
under the statute with respect to certain archaeological and 
ethnological material originating in Albania that is described in the 
Designated List set forth below in this document.
    These determinations include the following: (1) That Albania's 
cultural heritage is in jeopardy from pillage of certain types of 
archaeological material representing Albania's cultural heritage 
ranging in date from approximately 300,000 B.C. to A.D. 1750, and 
certain types of ethnological material representing Albania's cultural 
heritage ranging in date from approximately A.D. 400 to 1913 (19 U.S.C. 
2602(a)(1)(A)); (2) that the Albanian government has taken measures 
consistent with the Convention to protect its cultural patrimony (19 
U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(B)); (3) that import restrictions imposed by the 
United States would be of substantial benefit in deterring a serious 
situation of pillage and remedies less drastic are not available (19 
U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(C)); and (4) that the application of import 
restrictions as set forth in this final rule is consistent with the 
general interests of the international community in the interchange of 
cultural property among nations for scientific, cultural, and 
educational purposes (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(D)). The Acting Assistant 
Secretary also found that the material described in the determinations 
meets the statutory definition of ``archaeological or ethnological 
material of the State Party'' (19 U.S.C. 2601(2)).

The Agreement

    On August 23, 2021, the Governments of the United States and 
Albania signed a bilateral agreement, ``Memorandum of Understanding 
between the United States of America and the Republic of Albania 
Concerning the Imposition of Import Restrictions on Categories of 
Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Albania'' (hereinafter, 
``the Agreement''), pursuant to the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). 
The Agreement entered into force on February 28, 2022, following the 
exchange of diplomatic notes, and enables the promulgation of import 
restrictions on certain categories of archaeological material ranging 
in date from approximately 300,000 B.C. to A.D. 1750, and ethnological 
material ranging in date from approximately A.D. 400 to 1913. A list of 
the categories of archaeological and ethnological material subject to 
the import restrictions is set forth later in this document.

Restrictions and Amendment to the Regulations

    In accordance with the Agreement, importation of material 
designated below is subject to the restrictions of 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 
Sec.  12.104g(a) of title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 
12.104g(a)) and will be restricted from entry into the United States 
unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and Sec.  12.104c of 
the CBP regulations (19 CFR 12.104c) are met. CBP is amending Sec.  
12.104g(a) of the CBP regulations (19 CFR 12.104g(a)) to indicate that 
these import restrictions have been imposed.
    Import restrictions listed at 19 CFR 12.104g(a) are effective for 
no more than five years beginning on the date on which the Agreement 
enters into force with respect to the United States. This period may be 
extended for additional

[[Page 15080]]

periods of not more than five years if it is determined that the 
factors which justified the Agreement still pertain and no cause for 
suspension of the Agreement exists. The import restrictions will expire 
on February 28, 2027, unless extended.

D. Paintings

of Albania that may be absent from written records. Examples of 
paintings include, but are not limited to:
    1. Wall paintings--This category includes paintings on various

devotion, normally depicting saints, angels, or other religious 
figures. These are painted on a wooden panel, often for inclusion in a

be partially covered with gold and/or silver, sometimes encrusted with 
precious or semi-precious stone.
    3. Works on Leather and Paper--Paintings may be on leather,

    This category includes written records of religious, ritual, 
ceremonial, political, or scientific importance, including, but not 
limited to, works on papyrus, vellum or parchment, paper, or leather. 
Papyrus documents are often rolled and/or fragmentary. Parchment and

may have illustrations or illuminated paintings with gold or other 
colors, or be otherwise embellished with colorful floral or geometric 
motifs. There are also examples of Korans (Qur'ans) and other religious

includes daggers, swords, saifs, scimitars, other blades, with or 
without sheaths, as well as spears, firearms, and cannons. These may be 
inlaid with gemstones, embellished with silver or gold, or engraved 
with floral or geometric motifs and inscriptions. Grips or hilts may be 
made of metal, wood, and/or semi-precious stones, such as agate, and 
bound with leather. Armor consists of small metal scales, originally 
sewn to a backing of cloth or leather, and augmented by helmets, body 
armor, shields, and horse armor.

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public procedure 
under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). For the same reason, a delayed effective date 
is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply.

Executive Order 12866

    CBP has determined that this document is not a regulation or rule 
subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12866 because it pertains 
to a foreign affairs function of the United States, as described above, 
and therefore is specifically exempted by section 3(d)(2) of Executive 
Order 12866.

Signing Authority

    This regulation is being issued in accordance with 19 CFR 0.1(a)(1) 
pertaining to the Secretary of the Treasury's authority (or that of 
his/her delegate) to approve regulations related to customs revenue 
functions.

    Chris Magnus, the Commissioner of CBP, having reviewed and approved 
this document, has delegated the authority to electronically sign this
