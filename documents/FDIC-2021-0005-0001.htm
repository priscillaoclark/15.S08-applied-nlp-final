FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION

12 CFR Part 308

RIN 3064-AF69


FDIC Rules of Practice and Procedure; Technical Revisions

AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is amending 
its rules of practice and procedure to codify the agency's longstanding 
practice of having certain adjudicative functions performed by an 
inferior officer of the United States appointed by the FDIC's Board of 
Directors (Board). Additionally, the FDIC is making other technical 
edits to its rules of practice and procedure to update references to 
certain positions within the FDIC Legal Division whose titles are 
outdated.

DATES: The final rule is effective on January 12, 2021.

Division, (202) 898-3820, <a href="mailto:romjohnson@fdic.gov">romjohnson@fdic.gov</a>; Josephine M. Bahn,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    Administrative enforcement proceedings brought by the FDIC are 
subject to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 551 et 
seq., and the FDIC Rules of Practice and Procedure, 12 CFR part 308. 
Under part 308, evidentiary hearings and related proceedings are 
generally presided over by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). See 
generally, 5 U.S.C. 556; 12 CFR 308.5, and 308.3. Additionally, part 
308 provides that certain procedural and adjudicative functions are 
reserved to the Executive Secretary of the FDIC. These functions 
include but are not limited to: (1) Serving in place of an ALJ when no 
ALJ has jurisdiction over an administrative proceeding; (2) issuing 
rulings in certain administrative proceedings; and (3) serving as the 
custodian of records for administrative proceedings. See generally, 12 
CFR 308.102(b) and 308.105.
    On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the ALJs 
employed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were 
``inferior officers'' of the United States under the Appointments 
Clause of the United States Constitution because these ALJs hold a 
continuing office established by law, and they exercise ``significant 
discretion'' in connection with certain ``important functions'' when 
presiding over administrative hearings. Lucia v. SEC, 138 S. Ct. 2044, 
2053-2054 (2018) (Lucia). As inferior officers, the Supreme Court held 
that the SEC's ALJs are ``subject to the Appointments Clause and as 
such, can only be appointed by the President, ``Courts of Law'' or 
``Heads of Departments.'' See, Lucia, 138 S. Ct. 2044, 2046.
    Although the Lucia decision did not directly affect the FDIC or the 
ALJs for the FDIC, the Board nevertheless elected to formally appoint 
the ALJs that preside over FDIC enforcement proceedings. The ALJs who 
were serving at the time of the Lucia decision were appointed by the 
Board on July 19, 2018. See FDIC Board Resolution 085152. Since that 
time, the Board has appointed all ALJs that preside over FDIC 
enforcement proceedings.
    Since the Lucia decision, the FDIC has received questions regarding 
whether the FDIC's Executive Secretary was also appointed in a manner 
consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling in Lucia. In fact, the Board 
duly appointed the FDIC's current Executive Secretary as an inferior 
officer on June 22, 1997, pursuant to Article II of the United States 
Constitution and 12 U.S.C. 1819(a) (Fifth) (allowing the FDIC to 
``appoint by its Board of Directors such officers and employees as are 
not otherwise provided for in this chapter''). Nonetheless, in the 
interest of transparency and to assuage any outstanding concerns about 
this issue, we are amending part 308 to clarify and to expressly 
provide that such adjudicative functions will continue to be performed 
by an inferior officer of the United States (Administrative Officer) 
that has been duly appointed by the Board.
    In addition to clarifying that these adjudicative functions are 
performed by an Administrative Officer that is duly appointed by the 
Board, the FDIC is making technical changes to part 308 to update 
outdated references to certain position titles.

II. Exemption From Public Notice and Comment

    Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 
553) sets forth requirements for providing the general public notice 
of, and the opportunity to comment on, proposed agency rules. However, 
unless notice or hearing is required by statute, those requirements do 
not apply to interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules 
of agency organization, procedure, or practice. See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A).
    The FDIC is updating part 308, its rules of practice and procedure, 
to substitute the Administrative Officer for the Executive Secretary in 
multiple places. Since the changes relate to agency organization, 
procedure, or practice, the rules are being published in final form 
without public notice and comment.

III. Regulatory Analysis

A. Congressional Review Act

    Under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), ``[b]efore a rule can 
take effect, the Federal agency promulgating such rule shall submit to 
each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General a report 
containing--(i) a copy of the rule; (ii) a concise general statement 
relating to the rule, including whether it is a major rule; and (iii) 
the proposed effective date of the rule.'' \1\ The CRA further defines 
the term ``rule'' as having ``the meaning given such term in section 
551, except that such term does not include--(A) any rule of particular 
applicability . . . ; (B) any rule relating to agency management or 
personnel; or (C) any rule of agency organization, procedure, or 
practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations 
of non-agency parties.'' \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(1)(A).
    \2\ 5 U.S.C. 804(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FDIC is updating part 308, its rules of practice and procedure, 
to clarify that certain adjudicative functions, specified in part 308 
as being performed by the FDIC's Executive Secretary or Assistant 
Executive Secretary, will be performed by an ``Administrative Officer'' 
or ``Assistant Administrative Officer'' who has been duly appointed by 
the Board. Additionally, the FDIC is updating outdated references to 
certain position titles in part 308. These amendments do not constitute 
substantive changes, but merely conform the titles in the

[[Page 2247]]

regulation to the current titles of these positions.
    The clarifications relate to agency management and personnel, and 
to agency practice and procedure. Further, to the extent that non-
agency parties are impacted by the amended rules (i.e., they may be 
required to submit requests and documents to the attention of the 
Administrative Officer rather than the Executive Secretary), their 
rights and obligations will not be substantially affected. As such, 
submission to Congress and the Comptroller General is not required for 
the rules to become effective.

B. Paperwork Reduction Act

    This rule does not propose new or revisions to existing 
``collection[s] of information'' as that term is defined under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13, 44 U.S.C. chapter 
35, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320.

C. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not 
apply to a rulemaking where a general notice of proposed rulemaking is 
not required. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). As noted previously, the FDIC has 
determined that it is unnecessary to publish a notice of proposed 
rulemaking for the final rule amending part 308. Accordingly, the RFA's 
requirements relating to an initial and final regulatory flexibility 
analysis do not apply to this rulemaking for part 308.

D. Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994

    Pursuant to section 302(a) of the Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act (RCDRIA),\3\ in determining the effective 
date and administrative compliance requirements for new regulations 
that impose additional reporting, disclosure, or other requirements on 
insured depository institutions (IDIs), each Federal banking agency 
must consider, consistent with the principle of safety and soundness 
and the public interest, any administrative burdens that the 
regulations would place on depository institutions, including small 
depository institutions and customers of depository institutions, as 
well as the benefits of the regulations. In addition, section 302(b) of 
RCDRIA requires new regulations and amendments to regulations that 
impose additional reporting, disclosures, or other new requirements on 
IDIs generally to take effect on the first day of a calendar quarter 
that begins on or after the date on which the regulations are published 
in final form.\4\ The FDIC has determined that the rule would not 
impose additional reporting, disclosure, or other requirements; 
therefore the requirements of the RCDRIA do not apply.

    \4\ 12 U.S.C. 4802.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act \5\ requires the Federal 
banking agencies to use ``plain language'' in all proposed and final 
rules published after January 1, 2000. In light of this requirement, 
the FDIC has sought to present the final rule in a simple and 
straightforward manner.

and any reply, the Administrative Officer will promptly certify the 
entire record to the Board of Directors. Within 60 calendar days of the
