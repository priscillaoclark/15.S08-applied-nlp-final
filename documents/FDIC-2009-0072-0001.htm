FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION

12 CFR Parts 308 and 363

RIN 3064-AD21

 
Annual Independent Audits and Reporting Requirements

AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

ACTION: Final rule; correction.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: On July 20, 2009, the FDIC published in the Federal Register a 
final rule amending part 363 of its regulations concerning annual 
independent audits and reporting requirements for certain insured 
depository institutions, which implements section 36 of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), largely as proposed, but with certain 
modifications made in response to the comments received and making a 
technical amendment to its rules and procedures (part 308, subpart U) 
for the removal, suspension, or debarment of accountants and accounting 
firms. The publication of the final rule corrected certain errors in 
the original publication of the final rule, which had been published in 
the Federal Register on July 7, 2009. It has come to the attention of 
the FDIC that the July 20 re-publication included one additional error. 
This correction will rectify that oversight.

DATES: Effective Date: This correction is effective August 6, 2009.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 20, 2009, the FDIC published in the 
Federal Register a final rule amending part 363 of its regulations 
concerning annual independent audits and reporting requirements for 
certain insured depository institutions, which implements section 36 of 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), largely as proposed, but 
with certain modifications made in response to the comments received 
and making a technical amendment to its rules and procedures (part 308, 
subpart U) for the removal, suspension, or debarment of accountants and 
accounting firms. The July 20, 2009, publication of the final rule 
corrected certain errors in the original publication of the final rule, 
which had been published in the

Federal Register on July 7, 2009. It has come to the attention of the 
FDIC that the July 20 re-publication failed to include one further 
correction. This publication will rectify that oversight.
    The correction included in this Federal Register document corrects 
an error in the prior publication which caused an apparent 
inconsistency in the effective date.

2009 (74 FR 35726), make the following correction:
    On page 35744, the first sentence of the V. Effective and 
Compliance Dates section is corrected to read:
    Except as noted below, the final rule is effective August 6, 2009.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
