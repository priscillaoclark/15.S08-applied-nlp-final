Rules of Origin for Goods Imported Into the United States

AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland 
Security.

ACTION: Final rule; technical corrections.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document sets forth technical corrections to U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect recent changes in 
the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. The affected 
provisions, which are based in part on specified changes in tariff 
classification, comprise a codified system used for determining: the 
country of origin for marking purposes for goods imported under the 
Agreement Between the United States of America, the United Mexican 
States, and Canada (USMCA); determining the country of origin of 
imported goods for the purposes specified in paragraph 1 of Annex 311 
of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for outstanding 
pending NAFTA claims; determining whether an imported good is a new or 
different article of commerce under the United States-Morocco Free 
Trade Agreement and the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement; and 
for

[[Page 68339]]

determining the country of origin of textile and apparel products 
(other than those of Israel).

DATES: The final rule is effective on November 15, 2022.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    Section 102.20 of title 19 of the U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) regulations (19 CFR 102.20) prescribes the tariff 
shift rules that are used to determine country of origin for certain 
purposes. CBP first promulgated these codified rules (referred to as 
``the part 102 rules'') to fulfill the United States' commitment under 
Annex 311 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which 
required the parties to establish rules for determining whether a good 
is a good of a NAFTA country. The NAFTA Implementation Act, Public Law 
103-182, 107 Stat. 2057 (19 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), was repealed by the 
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (USMCA), 
Public Law 116-113, 134 Stat. 11 (19 U.S.C. Chapter 29), as of July 1, 
2020. On July 6, 2021, CBP published an interim final rule in the 
Federal Register (86 FR 35566) implementing certain portions of the 
USMCA, where CBP stated its decision to continue application of the 
current part 102 rules to determine the country of origin for marking 
purposes of imported goods under the USMCA. Thus, the part 102 rules 
remain in effect. Additionally, the part 102 rules are still applied 
for outstanding pending claims under NAFTA.
    The part 102 rules are also used for several other trade 
agreements. For instance, as indicated in the scope provision for part 
102 (Sec.  102.0), the rules set forth in Sec. Sec.  102.1 through 
102.21 also apply for purposes of determining whether an imported good 
is a new or different article of commerce under Sec.  10.769 of the 
United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement regulations and Sec.  10.809 
of the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement regulations. Section 
102.21 also provides the rules of origin for determination of country 
of origin of imported textile and apparel products for certain 
purposes, other than those that are products of Israel.

Need for Correction

    Pursuant to section 1205 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness 
Act of 1988 (codified at 19 U.S.C. 3005), the United States 
International Trade Commission (ITC) is required to keep the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) under continuous review 
and prepare investigations proposing modifications to the HTSUS to the 
President. In July 2015, the ITC issued ``Recommended Modifications in 
the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to Conform with Amendments to the 
Harmonized System Recommended by the World Customs Organization, and to 
Address Other Matters: Proposed Commission Recommendations,'' Inv. No. 
1205-11, USITC Publication No. 4556. The modifications proposed in the 
report were effective on January 1, 2017, pursuant to Presidential 
Proclamation 9549. 81 FR 87401, 87406 (Dec. 2, 2016). In July 2016, the 
ITC issued ``Commission Recommendations to the President to Modify the 
Tariff Nomenclature in Chapters 3, 44, and 63 of the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule,'' Inv. No. 1205-12, USITC Publication No. 4621. The 
modifications proposed in the report were effective on January 1, 2018, 
pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 9687. 82 FR 61413, 61417 (Dec. 
27, 2017). In April 2021, the ITC issued, ``Recommended Modifications 
to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, 2021,'' Inv. No. 1205-13, USITC 
Publication No. 5171. The modifications proposed in the report were 
effective on January 1, 2022, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 
10326. 86 FR 73593, 73597 (Dec. 28, 2021).
    As a result of these modifications to the HTSUS, certain tariff 
provisions were added or removed, and certain goods were transferred, 
for tariff classification purposes, to different or newly-created 
tariff provisions. The changes to the HTSUS involved product coverage 
and/or numbering of certain headings and subheadings and were not 
intended to have any other substantive effect. Accordingly, this 
document makes technical corrections to Sec. Sec.  102.20 and 102.21 in 
order for the regulations to conform the numbering in the tariff shift 
rules to the numbering in the current version of the HTSUS. This 
document also makes minor conforming changes to chapter notes 42, 64, 
70, and 96, and adds a new chapter note 65. In addition, this document 
also corrects typographical errors that occurred in previous updates.
    The following examples are offered to illustrate the need for 
technical corrections to Sec. Sec.  102.20 and 102.21.
    Example 1: Under current Sec.  102.20(o), there is a tariff shift 
rule for subheading 8469.00, HTSUS. Under the 2017 amendments to the 
HTSUS, heading 8469, HTSUS, which covered ``Typewriters other than 
printers of heading 8443; word processing machines,'' was deleted. The 
goods previously classified under this provision are now classified 
under subheading 8472.90. As a result, the terms of the tariff shift 
rule for subheading 8469.00 are being revised to reflect the fact that 
heading 8469, HTSUS, was deleted, as well as to indicate the transfer 
of goods to subheading 8472.90. In other words, instead of referring to 
the since-deleted heading 8469, the new tariff shift rules refer to 
heading 8472 or subheading 8472.90, as appropriate. Lastly, the rule, 
revised as described above, is now incorporated into the rule for goods 
of subheading 8471.60-8472.90.
    Example 2: Pursuant to the existing terms of Sec.  102.20(f), the 
tariff shift rules for subheading 2910.10-2910.90, HTSUS, permit a 
tariff shift to ``dieldrin (ISO, INN) of subheading 2910.40 from any 
other subheading, except from subheading 2910.90.'' The second part of 
the tariff shift rule for subheading 2910.10-2910.90, HTSUS, permits a 
tariff shift ``to subheading 2910.90 from any other subheading, except 
from subheading 2910.40.'' Under the 2017 amendments to the HTSUS, new 
subheading 2910.50, HTSUS, was created to provide separately for endrin 
(ISO), which was previously provided for in subheading 2910.90, HTSUS. 
This new subheading was created to facilitate monitoring and control of 
products under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic 
Pollutants. In order to maintain the original result of the tariff 
shift rules for subheading 2910.10-2910.90, HTSUS, the tariff shift 
rules in Sec.  102.20(f) must be amended to reflect the transfer of 
endrin (ISO) previously classified in subheading 2910.90 to new 
subheading 2910.50, HTSUS, as follows: ``[a] change to dieldrin (ISO, 
INN) of subheading 2910.40 from any other subheading, except from 
subheading 2910.50 through 2910.90.'' Similarly, the second part of the 
tariff shift rule for subheading 2910.10-2910.90, HTSUS, must also be 
amended to reflect the 2017 amendment that resulted in a transfer of 
endrin (ISO) from subheading 2910.90 to the newly created subheading 
2910.50, HTSUS. Additionally, the second tariff shift rule for 
subheadings 2910.10 through 2910.90 must be amended to provide for 
``[a] change to subheading 2910.50 through 2910.90,'' with the addition 
of

[[Page 68340]]

the phrase ``outside that group'' following the clause ``from any other 
subheading.'' The first clause is expanded to include a change to 
subheadings 2910.50 through 2910.90 to reflect the transfer of endrin 
(ISO) to subheading 2910.50, HTSUS. The purpose of the additional 
language ``outside that group'' after the clause, ``from any other 
subheading,'' is to clarify that the tariff shift rule is not triggered 
if there is a change to a good of subheadings 2910.50 through 2910.90, 
HTSUS, from a good of subheadings 2910.50 through 2910.90, HTSUS.
    Example 3: Pursuant to the existing terms of Sec.  102.21(e)(1), 
the tariff shift rule for subheadings 4202.32.40, HTSUS, through 
4202.32.95, HTSUS, permits a tariff shift to these subheadings ``from 
any other heading, provided that the change is the result of the good 
being wholly assembled in a single country, territory, or insular 
possession.'' Pursuant to the 2016 amendments to the HTSUS, the eight-
digit subheading 4202.32.95, HTSUS, which provided, in relevant part, 
for ``Articles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the 
handbag: With outer surface of sheeting of plastic or of textile 
materials: With outer surface of textile materials: Other: Other,'' was 
deleted. In its place, subheadings 4202.32.91 through 4202.32.99, 
HTSUS, were created to cover products that were previously classified 
in 4202.32.95, HTSUS. As subheading 4202.32.95, HTSUS, no longer exists 
in the HTSUS, Sec.  102.21(e)(1) must be amended to reflect the 
applicable renumbering of the tariff shift rule. Specifically, Sec.  
102.21(e)(1) must be amended to indicate that the tariff shift rule for 
subheadings 4202.32.40-4202.32.95, HTSUS, has been renumbered to 
subheadings 4202.32.40-4202.32.99, HTSUS. The new rule provides for ``A 
change to subheading 4202.32.40 through 4202.32.99 from any other 
heading, provided that the change is the result of the good being 
wholly assembled in a single country, territory, or insular 
possession.''
    Example 4: Pursuant to the existing terms of Sec.  102.21(e)(1), 
the tariff shift rule for subheading 7019.19.28, HTSUS, allows, in 
relevant part, that ``[i]f the good is of staple fibers, a change to 
subheading 7019.19.28 from any other subheading, except from subheading 
7019.19.30 through 7019.19.90, 7019.31.00 through 7019.39.50, and 
7019.90, and provided that the change is the result of a spinning 
process.'' Pursuant to the 2022 amendments to the HTSUS, the six-digit 
subheading 7019.19.28, HTSUS, which provided for ``Glass fibers 
(including glass wool) and articles thereof (for example, yarn, woven 
fabrics): Silvers, rovings, yarn and chopped strands: Other: Yarns: 
Colored: Other,'' was deleted. In its place, subheading 7019.13.28, 
HTSUS, was created, which provides for ``Glass fibers (including glass 
wool) and articles thereof (for example, yarn, rovings, woven fabrics): 
Silvers, rovings, yarn and chopped strands and mats thereof: Other 
yarn, silvers: Yarns: Colored: Other,'' and covers products that were 
previously classified in 7019.19.28, HTSUS. As subheading 7019.19.28, 
HTSUS, no longer exists in the HTSUS, Sec.  102.21(e)(1) must be 
amended to reflect the renumbering of the tariff shift rule. Similarly, 
amendments to Sec.  102.21(e)(1) must be made to reflect the following: 
subheading 7019.19.90, HTSUS, was deleted and replaced with subheadings 
7019.13.35, HTSUS, and 7019.19.91, HTSUS; subheading 7019.31.00, HTSUS, 
was deleted and replaced with subheadings 7019.14.00, HTSUS, and 
7019.15.00, HTSUS; subheading 7019.32.00, HTSUS, was deleted and 
replaced with 7019.71.00, HTSUS; subheading 7019.39.10, HTSUS, was 
deleted and replaced with 7019.80.10, HTSUS; and subheading 7019.39.50, 
HTSUS, was deleted and replaced with 7019.80.90, HTSUS.

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requirements in 5 U.S.C. 553 
govern agency rulemaking procedures. Section 553(b) of the APA 
generally requires notice and public comment before issuance of a final 
rule. In addition, section 553(d) of the APA generally requires that a 
final rule have a thirty-day delayed effective date. The APA, however, 
provides exceptions from the prior notice and public comment 
requirement and the delayed effective date requirements, when an agency 
for good cause finds that such procedures are impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.
    Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), CBP has determined for good cause 
that it would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest to 
delay publication of this rule in final form pending an opportunity for 
public comment because the technical corrections set forth in this 
document merely conform the tariff shift rules in the regulations to 
the current HTSUS and will facilitate trade by ensuring that country of 
origin determinations made using the regulations are consistent with 
the HTSUS. In addition, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), CBP has 
determined that there is good cause for this final rule to become 
effective immediately upon publication for the same reasons.

Executive Orders 12866

    These amendments do not meet the criteria for a ``significant 
regulatory action'' as specified in Executive Order 12866. 58 FR 51735 
(October 4, 1993).

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because this document is not subject to the notice and public 
procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553, it is not subject to the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).

Signing Authority

    This regulation is being issued in accordance with 19 CFR 0.1(a)(1) 
pertaining to the Secretary of the Treasury's authority (or that of 
his/her delegate) to approve regulations related to customs revenue 
functions. Pursuant to Treasury Directive 28-03, CBP retains authority 
to sign a document making non-substantive technical corrections to a 
previously issued regulation. For this reason, the CBP Commissioner is 
the proper official to sign this document.
    Chris Magnus, the Commissioner of CBP, having reviewed and approved 
this document, has delegated the authority to electronically sign this 
document to Robert F. Altneu, who is the Director of the Regulations 
and Disclosure Law Division for CBP, for purposes of publication in the 
Federal Register.
