Extension and Amendment of Import Restrictions on Archaeological 
Material and Imposition of Import Restrictions on Ethnological Material 
of Egypt

AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland 
Security; Department of the Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This final rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) regulations to reflect an extension and amendment of import 
restrictions on certain archaeological material and the imposition of 
import restrictions on ethnological material of the Arab Republic of 
Egypt (Egypt). The restrictions on archaeological material, which were 
originally imposed by CBP Dec. 16-23, were extended and amended on 
November 30, 2021. The Acting Assistant Secretary for Educational and 
Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the 
requisite determinations for extending and updating the import 
restrictions that previously existed, and the Governments of the United 
States and Egypt entered into a new agreement to reflect the extension 
of these import restrictions. Additionally, the Acting Assistant 
Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States 
Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for adding 
import restrictions on certain categories of ethnological material. The 
new agreement, which entered into force on November 30, 2021, 
supersedes the existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that became 
effective on November 30, 2016, and enabled the promulgation of the 
existing import restrictions. Accordingly, the current import 
restrictions and new import restrictions will be effective until 
November 30, 2026, and the CBP regulations are being amended to reflect 
this extension and imposition. To fulfill the terms of the new MOU, the 
Designated List of cultural property, which was described in CBP Dec. 
16-23, is amended in this document to reflect the addition and revision 
of categories of archaeological material of Egypt ranging in date from 
approximately 300,000 B.C. to A.D. 1750, and to include certain 
ethnological material ranging from A.D. 1517 to 1914.

DATES: Effective on December 1, 2021.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    Pursuant to the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, 
Public Law 97-446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. (hereinafter, ``the Cultural 
Property Implementation Act''), which implements the 1970 United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit 
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property 
(hereinafter, ``the Convention'' (823 U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)), the United 
States entered into a bilateral agreement with the Arab Republic of 
Egypt (Egypt) on November 30, 2016. The Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) enabled the promulgation of import restrictions on certain 
archaeological material representing Egypt's cultural heritage ranging 
from approximately 300,000 B.C. to A.D. 1750.
    On December 6, 2016, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
published CBP Dec. 16-23 in the Federal Register (81 FR 87805), which 
amended Sec.  12.104g(a) of title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(19 CFR 12.104g(a)) to reflect the imposition of import restrictions 
and included a list designating the types of archaeological material 
covered by the restrictions.
    Import restrictions listed at 19 CFR 12.104g(a) are effective for 
no more than five years beginning on the date on which the agreement 
enters into force with respect to the United States. This period may be 
extended for additional periods of not more than five years if it is 
determined that the factors which justified the initial agreement still 
pertain and no cause for suspension of the agreement exists. See 19 CFR 
12.104g(a).
    On February 5, 2021, the United States Department of State proposed 
in the Federal Register (86 FR 8476), to extend and amend the MOU 
between the United States and Egypt concerning the import restrictions 
on certain categories of archeological material of Egypt. On August 15, 
2021, after consultation with and recommendations by the Cultural 
Property Advisory Committee, the Acting Assistant Secretary for 
Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, 
determined that: (1) Egypt's cultural heritage continues to be in 
jeopardy from pillage of archeological resources and that the import 
restrictions should be updated and extended for an additional five 
years; and (2) Egypt's cultural heritage is in jeopardy from pillage of 
certain types of ethnological material, from Egypt, ranging in date 
from A.D. 1517 to A.D. 1914, and import restrictions on such types of 
ethnological material should be imposed.
    Subsequently, on November 30, 2021, the Governments of the United 
States and Egypt entered into a new agreement, titled ``Memorandum of 
Understanding Between the Government of the United States of America 
and the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt Concerning the 
Imposition of Import Restrictions on Categories of Cultural Property of 
Egypt.'' The new MOU supersedes the existing agreement that first 
entered into force on November 30, 2016. Pursuant to the new MOU, the 
import restrictions for archaeological material are updated and will be 
effective until November 30, 2026, along with the imposition of 
additional import restrictions on certain categories of ethnological 
material, which will also be effective until November 30, 2026.
    Accordingly, CBP is amending 19 CFR 12.104g(a) to reflect the 
extension of the import restrictions and amending the Designated List 
of cultural property described in CBP Dec. 16-23 with the addition and 
revision of categories of archaeological material of Egypt ranging in 
date from approximately 300,000 B.C. to A.D. 1750, as set forth below. 
The Designated List of cultural property described in CBP Dec. 16-23 is 
also amended by adding certain categories of ethnological material of 
Egypt ranging

[[Page 68547]]

in date from A.D. 1517 to 1914, as set forth below. The restrictions on 
the importation of archaeological and ethnological material will be in 
effect through November 30, 2026. Importation of such material of 
Egypt, as described in the Designated List below, will be restricted 
through that date unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 
19 CFR 12.104c are met.
    The Designated List and additional information may also be found at 
the following website address: <a href="https://eca.state.gov/cultural-heritage-center/cultural-property-advisory-committee/current-import-restrictions">https://eca.state.gov/cultural-heritage-center/cultural-property-advisory-committee/current-import-restrictions</a> 
by selecting the material for ``Egypt.''

Designated List of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Egypt

    The Designated List contained in CBP Dec. 16-23, which describes 
the types of articles to which the import restrictions apply, is 
amended to reflect the inclusion of additional archaeological material 
and certain ethnological material in the Designated List. In order to 
clarify certain provisions of the Designated List contained in CBP Dec. 
16-23, the amendment also includes minor revisions to the language and 
numbering of the Designated List. For the reader's convenience, CBP is 
reproducing the Designated List contained in CBP Dec. 16-23 in its 
entirety, with the changes, below.
    The Designated List includes archaeological material from Egypt 
ranging in date from approximately 300,000 B.C. to A.D. 1750, and 
certain ethnological material from Egypt ranging in date from A.D. 1517 
to 1914.

I. Archaeological Material

    Archaeological material includes categories of objects from the 
Paleolithic to the middle of the Ottoman period in Egypt, ranging in 
date from approximately 300,000 B.C. to A.D. 1750.
    A. Stone
    1. Sculpture
    i. Architectural Elements--This category includes architectural 
elements from temples, tombs, palaces, mosques, churches, monasteries, 
commemorative monuments, and domestic architecture, including doors, 
door frames, window fittings, columns, capitals, bases, lintels, jambs, 
roofs, pediment, archways, friezes, pilasters, engaged columns, prayer 
niches (mihrabs), fountains, inlays, and blocks from walls, floors, and 
ceilings. Examples are often decorated in relief with ornamental 
Pharaonic, Greco-Roman, Coptic, and Islamic motifs and inscriptions. 
Limestone, sandstone, and granite are most commonly used. Stone is 
often reused.
    ii. Statues--Types include large- and small-scale representations 
of humans, animals, and hybrid figures with a human body and animal 
head. Human figures may be standing, usually with the left foot 
forward, seated on a block or on the ground, kneeling, or prone. 
Figures in stone may be supported by a slab of stone at the back. 
Greco-Roman examples use traditional Egyptian poses with Hellenistic 
modeling. Limestone, granite, basalt, sandstone (including greywacke), 
and diorite are most commonly used. Reuse of statues is common with re-
inscription of cartouche and other visible re-carving.
    iii. Relief Sculpture--Types include large- and small-scale 
sculpture, including Neolithic and Predynastic greywacke votive and 
cosmetic palettes, limestone wall reliefs depicting scenes of daily 
life and rituals, and steles/stelae and plaques in a variety of stones 
for funerary and commemorative purposes.
    iv. Tombstones--This category includes tombstones and grave markers 
made of marble, limestone, or other kinds of stone. They may be carved 
in relief and/or have decorative moldings.
    2. Vessels and Containers--This category includes conventional 
shapes such as bowls, cups, jars, and lamps. This category also 
includes vessels having the form of human, animal, hybrid, plant, 
hieroglyphic signs, and combinations or parts thereof.
    3. Funerary Objects and Equipment
    i. Sarcophagi and Coffins--This category includes sarcophagi and 
coffins with separate lids, either in the form of a large rectangular 
box, or human-shaped (anthropoid) and carved with modeled human 
features. Both types are often decorated outside, and sometimes inside, 
with incised or painted images and text inscriptions.
    ii. Canopic Shrines--This category includes shrines in the form of 
a box with space inside for four canopic jars.
    iii. Canopic Jars--This category includes jars with plain lids or 
lids in the form of human or animal heads and used to hold the internal 
organs of the deceased. A full set includes four jars. Sometimes these 
jars are dummies, carved from a single piece of stone with no interior 
space.
    4. Objects of Daily Use--This category includes chests and boxes, 
furniture, headrests, writing and painting equipment, games, and game 
pieces.
    5. Tools and Weapons--Chipped stone types include large and small 
blades, borers, scrapers, sickles, burins, notches, retouched flakes, 
cleavers, knives, chisels, awls, harpoons, cores, loom weights, and 
arrowheads. Ground stone types include grinders (e.g., mortars,

    ii. Amulets--This category includes amulets of colored and semi-
precious stones in the form of humans, animals, hybrids, plants, 
hieroglyphic signs, and combinations or parts thereof.
    iii. Stamp and Cylinder Seals--These are small devices with at 
least one side engraved (in intaglio and relief) with a design for 
stamping or sealing. The most common type is the scarab, in the form of 
a beetle with an inscription on the flat base.
    7. Ostraca--Chips of stone used as surfaces for writing or drawing.
    B. Metal
    1. Sculpture
    i. Statues--Types include large- and small-scale, including human, 
animal, and hybrid figures similar to those in stone. Metal statues 
usually lack the support at the back. The most common materials are 
bronze and copper alloys, but gold and silver are used as well.
    ii. Relief sculpture--Types include plaques, appliques, and mummy 
masks. Reliefs may include inscriptions in various languages.
    2. Vessels and Containers--This category includes conventional 
shapes such as bowls, cups, jars, plates, cauldrons, lamps, lampstands, 
scroll and manuscript containers, reliquaries, incense burners, and 
vessels in the form of humans, animals, hybrids, plants, hieroglyphic 
signs, and combinations or parts thereof.
    3. Objects of Daily Use--This category includes musical 
instruments, including trumpets, clappers, and sistra.
    4. Tools--Types include axes, adzes, saws, scrapers, trowels, 
locks, keys, nails, hinges, mirrors, ingots, thimbles, fibulae (for 
pinning clothing), drills, chisels, knives, hooks, needles, tongs, 
tweezers, and weights in copper alloy, bronze, and iron.

    i. Weapons--Types include mace heads, knives, daggers, swords, 
curved swords, axes, arrows, javelins, arrowheads, and spears in copper 
alloy, bronze, and iron.
    ii. Armor--Early armor consisted of small metal scales, originally 
sewn to a backing of cloth or leather, later augmented by helmets, body 
armor (cuirasses, bracers, shin guards), shields, and horse armor.
    6. Jewelry, Amulets, and Seals
    i. Jewelry--This category includes jewelry made of gold, silver, 
copper, and iron for personal adornment, including necklaces, chokers, 
pectorals, finger rings, beads, pendants, bells, belts, buckles, 
earrings, diadems, straight pins and fibulae, bracelets, anklets, 
girdles, wreaths and crowns, cosmetic accessories and tools, metal 
strigils (scrapers), crosses, and lamp holders.
    ii. Amulets--Types include amulets in the form of humans, human 
organs and parts, animals, hybrids, plants, hieroglyphic signs, 
deities, religious symbols, and combinations or parts thereof.
    7. Late Antique Christian, Greek Orthodox, and Coptic Liturgical 
Objects--Types include censers, crosses, Bible caskets, lamps, patens, 
Eucharistic goblets, icons, and iconostases.
    8. Coins--Types appear in copper or bronze, silver, and gold.
    i. Dynasty 30--Coins of this type have the hieroglyphs nwb nfr on 
one side and a horse on the other.
    ii. Dynasty 31--Coins of this type are Egyptian imitations of 
silver Athenian coins that depict the helmeted head of

[[Page 68549]]

Athena on the obverse and owl on the reverse with an inscription in 
Demotic (looks cursive) to the right of the owl. There are similar 
coins in silver but with an inscription in Aramaic (look angular) to 
the right of the owl. The former were struck under the authority of the 
Persian Great King Artaxerxes III when he recaptured Egypt in the mid-
4th B.C.; the latter were struck under the Persian satraps of Egypt 
Sabaces and Mazakes in the 330s B.C. There are rare silver drachms 
marked NAU (Naucratis) instead of A[Theta]E.
    iii. Hellenistic and Ptolemaic--Coins of this type are struck in 
gold, silver, and bronze at Alexandria and any other mints that 
operated within the borders of the modern Egyptian state. Gold coins of 
and in honor of Alexander the Great, struck at Alexandria and Memphis, 
depict a helmeted bust of Athena on the obverse and a winged Victory on 
the reverse. Silver coins of Alexander the Great, struck at Alexandria 
and Memphis, depict a bust of Herakles wearing the lion skin on the 
obverse, or ``heads'' side, and a seated statue of Olympian Zeus on the 
reverse, or ``tails'' side. Gold coins of the Ptolemies from Egypt will 
have jugate portraits on both obverse and reverse, a portrait of the 
king on the obverse and a cornucopia on the reverse, or a jugate 
portrait of the king and queen on the obverse and cornucopias on the 
reverse. Silver coins of the Ptolemies from Egypt tend to depict a 
portrait of Alexander wearing an elephant skin on the obverse and 
Athena on the reverse or a portrait of the reigning king with an eagle 
on the reverse. Some silver coins have jugate portraits of the king and 
queen on the obverse. Bronze coins of the Ptolemies commonly depict a 
head of Zeus (bearded) on the obverse and an eagle on the reverse. 
These iconographical descriptions are non-exclusive and describe only 
some of the more common examples. There are other types and variants 
among the Hellenistic and Ptolemaic coinage. Approximate date: ca. 332 
B.C. through ca. 31 B.C.
    iv. Roman--Coins of this type are struck in bronze, silver, or gold 
at Alexandria and any other mints that operated within the borders of 
the modern Egyptian state until approx. A.D. 498. The iconography of 
the coinage in the Roman period varied widely, although a portrait of 
the reigning emperor is almost always present on the obverse of the 
coin. Approximate dates: ca. 31 B.C. through ca. A.D. 498.
    v. Byzantine and Arab Byzantine--Coins of these types are struck in 
bronze and gold at Alexandria, Fustat, and other mints that operated 
within the borders of the modern Egyptian state between A.D. 498 and 
ca. A.D. 696. Iconography may include one, two, or three persons (busts 
or standing figures); large letters in Latin script (sometimes with 
smaller Latin, Greek, or Arabic letters along the edge); and crosses, 
stars, moons, and other symbols.
    vi. Islamic/Medieval and Ottoman--Coins of this type are struck in 
copper, bronze, silver, and gold at Cairo, Fustat, Alexandria, and 
other mints that operated within the borders of the modern Egyptian 
state under the Umayyad, `Abbasid, Tulunid, Ikhshidid, Fatimid, 
Ayyubid, Mamluk, and Ottoman (up to A.D. 1750) dynasties. Iconography 
is mostly writing in Arabic script, sometimes with stars, circles, 
flowers, or other ornaments placed at center or among the text, and 
rarely with human figures or trees.
    C. Ceramic and Clay
    1. Sculpture--This category includes terracotta statues and 
statuettes (figurines), including human, animal, and hybrid figures. 
Ceramic sculptures may be undecorated or decorated with paint, 
appliques, or inscribed lines.
    2. Architectural Decorations--These are baked clay (terracotta) 
elements used to decorate buildings. Examples include carved and molded 
brick, panels, acroteria, antefixes, painted and relief plaques, 
revetments, carved and molded bricks, knobs, plain or glazed roof 
tiles, and glazed tile wall ornaments and panels.
    3. Vessels and Containers
    i. Neolithic--Types are made of red Nile clay with blackened rim, 
thin walls, and rippled surface. Others have smoothed surfaces, but 
otherwise plain. Decorations may include painting or incised designs.
    ii. Predynastic Period--Types typically have a burnished red body 
with or without a white-painted decoration, or a burnished red body and 
black top, or a burnished black body sometimes with incised decoration, 
or an unburnished light brown body with dark red painted decoration, 
including human and animal figures and boats, spirals, or an abstract 
design.
    iv. Dynastic Periods--Types are primarily utilitarian but also come 
as ornate forms, typically undecorated and sometimes burnished. New 
Kingdom examples may have elaborate painted, incised, and molded 
decorations, especially floral motifs depicted in blue paint.
