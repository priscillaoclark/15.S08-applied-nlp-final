SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background

    Pursuant to the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, 
Public Law 97-446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq., which implements the 1970 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the 
Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property 
(823 U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)), the United States entered into a bilateral 
agreement with the Republic of Mali (Mali) on September 19, 1997, 
concerning the imposition of import restrictions on archaeological 
material from Mali (the 1997 Agreement).\1\ The 1997 Agreement included 
among the materials covered by the restrictions, archaeological 
material from the region of the Niger River Valley of Mali and the 
Bandiagara Escarpment (Cliff), Mali, then subject to the emergency 
restrictions imposed by the former U.S. Customs Service (U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection's (CBP) predecessor) in Treasury Decision (T.D.) 
93-74 (58 FR 49428 (September 23, 1993)). These emergency import 
restrictions were imposed pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2603(c) and 19 CFR 
12.104g(b) and effective for a period of five years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The 1997 Agreement was entered into following the emergency 
imposition of import restrictions on archaeological objects from the 
region of the Niger River Valley of Mali and the Bandiagara 
Escarpment (Cliff), Mali. The emergency restrictions were imposed by 
the former U.S. Customs Service in Treasury Decision (T.D.) 93-74 
and were published in the Federal Register (58 FR 49428) on 
September 23, 1993. The 1997 Agreement replaced the emergency 
restrictions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On September 23, 1997, the former U.S. Customs Service published 
T.D. 97-80 in the Federal Register (62 FR 49594), which amended 19 CFR 
12.104g(a) to reflect the imposition of these restrictions, and 
included a list designating the types of archaeological material 
covered by the restrictions.
    Import restrictions listed at 19 CFR 12.104g(a) are effective for 
no more than five years beginning on the date on which an agreement 
enters into force with respect to the United States. This period may be 
extended for additional periods of no more than five years if it is 
determined that the factors which justified the agreement still pertain 
and no cause for suspension of the agreement exists. See 19 CFR 
12.104g(a).
    Since the initial final rule was published on September 23, 1997, 
the import restrictions were subsequently extended and/or amended four 
(4) times. First, on September 20, 2002, the former U.S. Customs 
Service published T.D. 02-55 in the Federal Register (67 FR 59159) to 
extend the import restrictions for an additional five-year period.
    Second, on September 19, 2007, CBP published CBP Decision (Dec.) 
07-77 in the Federal Register (72 FR 53414), to extend the import 
restrictions for an additional five-year period and to impose import 
restrictions on new subcategories of objects throughout Mali from the 
Paleolithic Era (Stone Age) to approximately the mid-eighteenth 
century.
    Third, on September 19, 2012, CBP published CBP Dec. 12-14 in the 
Federal Register (77 FR 58020), to extend the import restrictions for 
an additional five-year period.
    Fourth and lastly, on September 19, 2017, CBP published CBP Dec. 
17-12 in the Federal Register (82 FR 43692), to extend the import 
restrictions for an additional five-year period and to impose import 
restrictions on certain categories of ethnological material, 
specifically, manuscripts dating between the twelfth and twentieth 
centuries, in paper.
    On January 6, 2022, the United States Department of State proposed 
in the Federal Register (87 FR 791) to extend and amend the agreement 
between the United States and Mali concerning the import restrictions 
on certain categories of archaeological and ethnological material from 
Mali. On April 27, 2022, the Assistant Secretary for Educational and 
Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, determined that: 
(1) the cultural heritage of Mali continues to be in jeopardy from 
pillage of certain archaeological and ethnological material currently 
covered and that the import restrictions should be extended for an 
additional five years; and (2) the cultural heritage of Mali is in 
jeopardy from pillage of additional categories of archaeological 
material found throughout the entirety of Mali and additional 
categories of ethnological material associated with religious 
activities, ceremonies, or rites, and that import restrictions should 
be imposed on such additional categories. Pursuant to the new 
agreement, the existing import restrictions will remain in effect for 
an additional five years through September 13, 2027, along with the 
imposition of additional import

[[Page 57143]]

restrictions on new categories of archaeological and ethnological 
material mentioned above and added to the Designated List, which will 
also be effective for a five-year period through September 13, 2027.
    Accordingly, CBP is amending 19 CFR 12.104g(a) to reflect the 
extension of the import restrictions and amending the Designated List 
of cultural property described in CBP Dec. 17-12 with the addition of 
categories of archaeological material including, but not limited to, 
objects of ceramic, leather, metal, stone, glass, textiles, and wood, 
and certain additional categories of ethnological material associated 
with religious activities, ceremonies, or rites of traditional African 
or Islamic cultures or religions; architectural elements; and funerary 
objects; all at least 100 years old. The restrictions on the 
importation of archaeological material and ethnological material 
continue to be in effect through September 13, 2027. Importation of 
such materials from Mali continues to be restricted through that date 
unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 19 CFR 12.104c 
are met.
    The Designated List and additional information may also be found at 
the following website address: <a href="https://eca.state.gov/cultural-heritage-center/cultural-property-advisory-committee/current-import-restrictions">https://eca.state.gov/cultural-heritage-center/cultural-property-advisory-committee/current-import-restrictions</a> 
by selecting ``Mali'' from the list.

Designated List of Archaeological and Ethnological Material From Mali

    This Designated List, amended as set forth in this document, 
includes archaeological material that originates in Mali, ranging in 
date from the Paleolithic Era (Stone Age) to approximately the mid-

additional categories of archaeological material found throughout the 
entirety of Mali. These categories include, but are not limited to, 
objects of ceramic, leather, metal, stone, glass, textiles, and wood. 
The Designated List also includes certain categories of ethnological 
material, namely, manuscripts dating between the twelfth and twentieth 
centuries A.D., in paper, and is amended to include new categories of

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public procedure 
under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). For the same reason, a delayed effective date 
is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply.

Executive Order 12866

    CBP has determined that this document is not a regulation or rule 
subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12866 because it pertains 
to a foreign affairs function of the United States, as described above, 
and therefore is specifically exempted by section 3(d)(2) of Executive 
Order 12866.

Signing Authority

    This regulation is being issued in accordance with 19 CFR 
0.1(a)(1), pertaining to the Secretary of the Treasury's authority (or 
that of his/her delegate) to approve regulations related to customs 
revenue functions.
    Chris Magnus, the Commissioner of CBP, having reviewed and approved 
this document, has delegated the authority to electronically sign this 
document to Robert F. Altneu, who is the Director of the Regulations 
and Disclosure Law Division for CBP, for purposes of publication in the 
Federal Register.

List of Subjects in 19 CFR Part 12

    Cultural property, Customs duties and inspection, Imports, 
Prohibited merchandise, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

Amendment to the CBP Regulations

    For the reasons set forth above, part 12 of title 19 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (19 CFR part 12) is amended as set forth below:
