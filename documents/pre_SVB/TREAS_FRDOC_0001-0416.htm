SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    Pursuant to the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, 
Public Law 97-446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq., which implements the 1970 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the 
Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property 
(823 U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)), the United States entered into a bilateral 
agreement with the Republic of Cyprus (``Cyprus'') on July 16, 2002, 
concerning the imposition of import restrictions on certain 
archaeological materials representing the Pre-Classical and Classical 
periods of Cyprus, ranging in date from approximately the 8th 
Millennium B.C. to approximately A.D. 330 (``the 2002 Agreement'').
    On July 19, 2002, the former U.S. Customs Service (U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection's predecessor agency) published Treasury Decision 
(T.D.) 02-37 in the Federal Register (67 FR 47447), which amended Sec.  
12.104g(a) of title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 
12.104g(a)) to reflect the imposition of these restrictions and 
included a list designating the types of archaeological and 
ethnological material covered by the restrictions.
    Import restrictions listed at 19 CFR 12.104g(a) are effective for 
no more than five years beginning on the date on which the agreement 
enters into force with respect to the United States. This period may be 
extended for additional periods of no more than five years if it is 
determined that the factors which justified the agreement still pertain 
and no cause for suspension of the agreement exists. See 19 CFR 
12.104g(a).
    Since the initial final rule was published on July 19, 2002, the 
import restrictions were subsequently extended and/or amended five (5) 
times. First, on August 17, 2006, the Republic of Cyprus and the United 
States amended the 2002 Agreement (covering Pre-Classical and Classical 
archeological materials) to include Byzantine ecclesiastical and ritual 
ethnological materials dating from approximately the 4th century A.D. 
through approximately the 15th century A.D. that had been (and, at that 
time, were still) protected pursuant to an emergency action which was 
published in the Federal Register (64 FR 17529) on April 12, 1999. The 
amendment of the 2002 Agreement to cover both the archaeological 
materials and the ethnological materials was reflected in CBP Dec. 06-
22, which was published in the Federal Register (71 FR 51724) on August 
31, 2006. CBP Dec. 06-22 contained the list of Byzantine ecclesiastical 
and ritual ethnological materials from Cyprus previously protected 
pursuant to the emergency action and announced that import 
restrictions, as of August 31, 2006, were imposed on this cultural 
property pursuant to the amended Agreement (19 U.S.C. 2603(c)(4)). 
Thus, as of that date, the import restrictions covering materials 
described in CBP Dec. 06-22 were set to be effective through July 15, 
2007.
    Second, on July 13, 2007, following the exchange of diplomatic 
notes, CBP published a final rule (CBP Dec. 07-52) in the Federal 
Register (72 FR 38470) to extend the import restrictions for an 
additional five-year period.
    Third, on July 13, 2012, following the exchange of diplomatic 
notes, CBP published a final rule (CBP Dec. 12-13) in the Federal 
Register (77 FR 41266) amending CBP regulations to reflect the 
extension of import restrictions for an additional five-year period and 
also to cover Post-Byzantine ecclesiastical and ritual ethnological 
materials of Cyprus ranging from approximately A.D. 1500 to 
approximately A.D. 1850.
    Fourth, on August 1, 2012, CBP published a correcting amendment to 
CBP Dec. 12-13 in the Federal Register (77 FR 45479), because the 
amended Designated List and the regulatory text in the July 13, 2012 
document contained language which was inadvertently inconsistent with 
the remainder of the document as to the historical period that the 
import restrictions cover for ecclesiastical and ritual ethnological 
materials from Cyprus.
    Fifth and lastly, on July 14, 2017, following the exchange of 
diplomatic notes, CBP published a final rule (CBP Dec. 17-07) in the 
Federal Register (82 FR 32452) to extend the import restrictions for an 
additional five-year period through July 15, 2022.
    On September 13, 2021, the United States Department of State 
proposed in the Federal Register (86 FR 50931) to extend and amend the 
agreement between the United States and Cyprus concerning the import 
restrictions on certain categories of archaeological and ethnological 
material from Cyprus. On April, 1, 2022, after consultation with and 
recommendations by the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, the 
Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States 
Department of State, determined that: (1) the cultural heritage of 
Cyprus continues to be in jeopardy from pillage of certain 
archeological and ethnological material currently covered and that the 
import restrictions should be extended for an additional five years; 
and (2) the cultural heritage of Cyprus is in jeopardy from pillage of 
additional categories of archaeological material dating from the end of 
the Classical Period to A.D. 1770 and additional categories of 
ethnological material including architectural material, documents and 
manuscripts, traditional clothing, and emblems of the state, and that 
import restrictions on such types of archaeological and ethnological 
material should be imposed. Pursuant to the new agreement, the existing 
import restrictions will remain in effect for an additional five years 
through July 13, 2027, along with the imposition of additional import 
restrictions on new categories of archaeological and ethnological 
material, which will also be effective for a five-year period through 
July 13, 2027.
    Accordingly, CBP is amending 19 CFR 12.104g(a) to reflect the 
extension of the import restrictions and amending the Designated List 
of cultural property described in CBP Dec. 12-13 with the addition of 
new categories of archaeological and ethnological material. The 
restrictions on the importation of archaeological material and 
ethnological material continue to be in effect through July 13, 2027. 
Importation of such material from Cyprus continues to be restricted 
through that date unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 
19 CFR 12.104c are met.
    The Designated List and additional information may also be found at 
the following website address: <a href="https://eca.state.gov/cultural-heritage-center/cultural-property-advisory-committee/current-import-restrictions">https://eca.state.gov/cultural-heritage-center/cultural-property-advisory-committee/current-import-restrictions</a> 
by selecting the material for ``Cyprus.''

structural and decorative architectural material, documents and 
manuscripts, and traditional clothing that contribute to the knowledge 
of the origins, development, and history of the Cypriot people. This 
includes objects from the 4th century A.D. starting in the Byzantine 
Period and ending in A.D. 1878 with the British Protectorate.

A. Ecclesiastical Ritual and Ceremonial Objects

    1. Metal.
    a. Bronze--Ceremonial objects include icons, small figural 
sculpture, crosses, censers (incense burners), rings, and buckles for 
ecclesiastical garments. The objects may be decorated with engraved or 
modeled designs or Greek inscriptions. Crosses, rings and buckles are 
often set with semi-precious stones.
    b. Lead--Lead objects include ampulla (small bottle-shaped forms) 
used in religious observance.
    c. Silver and Gold--Ceremonial vessels and objects used in ritual 
and as components of church treasure. Ceremonial objects include icons, 
censers (incense burners), book covers, liturgical crosses, 
archbishop's crowns, buckles, and chests including reliquaries. These 
are often decorated with molded or incised geometric motifs or scenes 
from the Bible, and encrusted with semi-precious or precious stones. 
The gems themselves may be engraved with religious figures or 
inscriptions. Church treasure may include all of the above, as well as 
rings, earrings, and necklaces (some decorated with ecclesiastical 
themes) and other implements (e.g., spoons).
    2. Wood--Artifacts made of wood are primarily those intended for 
ritual or ecclesiastical use. These include painted icons, painted wood 
screens (iconostases), carved doors, crosses, painted wooden beams from 
churches or monasteries, thrones, chests including reliquaries, and 
musical instruments. Religious figures (Christ, the Apostles, the 
Virgin, and others) predominate in the painted and carved figural 
decoration. Ecclesiastical furniture and architectural elements may 
also be decorated with geometric or floral designs.
    3. Ivory and Bone--Ecclesiastical and ritual objects of ivory and 
bone boxes, plaques, pendants, candelabra, stamp rings, crosses, and

buildings. These generally portray images of Christ, Archangels, the 
Apostles, and Saints in scenes of Biblical events. Surrounding panels 
may contain animal, floral, or geometric designs.
    b. Floor Mosaics--Floor mosaics from ecclesiastical contexts. 
Examples include the mosaics at Nea Paphos, Kourion, Kouklia, 
Chrysopolitissa Basilica and Campanopetra Basilica. Floor mosaics may 
have animal, floral, geometric designs, or inscriptions.
    7. Funerary Objects--This category includes objects related to 
funerary rites and burials in all materials. Examples of funerary 
objects include, but are not limited to, the following objects:
    a. Sepulchers--Sepulchers are repositories for remains of the dead, 
primarily in stone (usually limestone or marble), but also in metal and 
wood. Types of burial containers include sarcophagi, caskets, coffins, 
and urns. These may also have associated sculpture in relief or in the 
round. May be plain or have figural, geometric, or floral motifs either 
painted or carved in relief. May also contain human or animal remains.
    b. Inscriptions, Memorial Stones, Epitaphs, and Tombstones--This 
category includes inscribed funerary objects, primarily slabs in 
limestone, marble, and ceramic; engraved in a variety of languages and 
scripts. These may also have associated sculpture in relief or in the 
round.
    8. Frescoes/Wall Paintings--Wall paintings from religious 
structures (churches, monasteries, chapels, etc.). Like the mosaics, 
wall paintings generally portray images of Christ, Archangels, the 
Apostles, and Saints in scenes of Biblical events. Surrounding 
paintings may contain animal, floral, or geometric designs.

B. Emblems of the State

    This category includes items that provide information on periods of 
social and political history of the people of Cyprus from the Byzantine 
Period through the end of the Ottoman Period that may be absent from 
written records.

court, or government position, and other accessories thereof such as 
shoes, headdresses and hats, belts, and jewelry.
    2. Weapons and Armor.
    a. Weapons--These are often in iron, steel, or other metal. This 
category includes arrows, daggers, swords, saifs, scimitars, other 
blades with or without sheaths, spears, and pre-industrial firearms and 
cannon; may be for use in combat or ceremonial. May be inlaid with 
gemstones, embellished with silver or gold, or engraved with floral or 
geometric motifs. Grips or hilts may be made of metal, wood, or semi-
precious stones such as agate, or bound with leather.
    b. Armor--Armor may consist of small metal scales, originally sewn 
to a backing of textile or leather. This type also includes helmets, 
body armor, shields, and horse armor. Other objects may be made of 
leather, including archer's bags, shields, and masks.

court; flags, banners, flagstaffs, and finials.
    6. Musical Instruments--This category includes instruments 
important for state ceremonies, such as drums of various sizes in 
leather, metal instruments, such as cymbals and trumpets, and wooden 
instruments.

C. Structural and Decorative Architectural Material

    This category includes architectural elements and decoration from 
religious and public buildings. These buildings are comparatively rare 
due to the combination of historical influences on the island of 
Cyprus, including successive cycles of Arab and Byzantine conquest, 
occupation during the Medieval Crusades, and a period of Ottoman 
influence.
    1. Structural Material--Usually in stone, plaster, metal, or wood, 
including blocks; columns, capitals, bases, lintels, jambs, friezes, 
and pilasters; panels, doors, door frames, and window fittings; altars, 
prayer niches (mihrab), screens, iconostasis, fountains, ceilings, tent 
poles, and carved and molded brick.
    2. Relief and Inlay Sculpture--Usually in stone or plaster, 
includes relief and inlay sculpture such as appliques and plaques that 
may have been part of a building. May be plain, molded, carved, or 
inscribed. Decorative motifs may be incised or in high relief.
    3. Other Decorative Material--In stone, metal, wood, glass, and 
plaster. Metal elements are primarily in copper, brass, lead, and 
alloys, and may include doors, door fixtures, lathes, finials, 
chandeliers, screens, and sheets to protect domes. Glass elements 
include windows and mosaic tesserae in floors, walls, and ceilings.

D. Documents and Manuscripts

    This category includes written records of religious, political, or 
scientific importance, including, but not limited to, the following:
    1. Works on Papyrus, Parchment, Paper, or Leather--Papyrus 
documents are often rolled and/or fragmentary. Parchment and paper 
documents may be single leaves or bound as scrolls or books. Works on 
paper and parchment may have illustrations or illuminated paintings 
with gold or other colors. There are also examples of religious and/or 
rare books written on leather pages.
    2. Containers and Covers--Boxes for books or scrolls made of wood 
or other organic materials, and book or manuscript covers made of 
leather, textile, or metal.

E. Traditional Clothing and Textiles

    Traditional Cypriot clothing and textiles were signifiers of 
identity, social status, and culture, providing information about the 
multiple religious and ethnic populations in Cyprus from the Byzantine 
through Ottoman periods which may be absent from written records as 
historical documents rarely address ceremonies or social customs of 
non-elite groups. This category includes, but is not limited to, 
headdresses, headbands, hats, and pins (fez, kasketo); pants, dresses, 
and other body covers (karpastiki, pafitki, sayia/saya, sarka, 
doupletti, foustani, routzieti, vraka, gileko, zimbouni); aprons, belts 
and girdles (zonari), and socks (klatses) and shoes (frangopodines, 
scarpes).

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public procedure 
under 5 U.S.C.

[[Page 42642]]

553(a)(1). For the same reason, a delayed effective date is not 
required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply.

Executive Order 12866

    CBP has determined that this document is not a regulation or rule 
subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12866 because it pertains 
to a foreign affairs function of the United States, as described above, 
and therefore is specifically exempted by section 3(d)(2) of Executive 
Order 12866.

Signing Authority

    This regulation is being issued in accordance with 19 CFR 
0.1(a)(1), pertaining to the Secretary of the Treasury's authority (or 
that of his/her delegate) to approve regulations related to customs 
revenue functions.
