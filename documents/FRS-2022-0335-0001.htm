FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

12 CFR Part 204

[Regulation D; Docket No. R-1791]
RIN 7100-AG 47


Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions

AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Board is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of 
Depository Institutions, to reflect the annual indexing of the reserve 
requirement exemption amount and the low reserve tranche for 2023. The 
annual indexation of these amounts is required notwithstanding the 
Board's action in March 2020 of setting all reserve requirement ratios 
to zero. The Regulation D amendments set the reserve requirement 
exemption amount for 2023 at $36.1 million (increased from $32.4 
million in 2022) and the amount of the low reserve tranche at $691.7 
million (increased from $640.6 million in 2022). The adjustments to 
both of these amounts are derived using statutory formulas specified in 
the Federal Reserve Act (the ``Act''). The annual indexation of the 
reserve requirement exemption amount and low reserve tranche, though 
required by statute, will not affect depository institutions' reserve 
requirements, which will remain zero.

DATES: 
    Effective date: January 3, 2023.
    Compliance date: The new low reserve tranche and reserve 
requirement exemption amount will apply beginning January 1, 2023.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Benjamin Snodgrass, Senior Counsel 
(202-263-4877), Kristen Payne, Lead Financial Institution and Policy 
Analyst (202-452-2872), or Francis A. Martinez, Lead Financial 
Institution and Policy Analyst (202-245-4217), Division of Monetary 
Affairs, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th and C 
Streets NW, Washington, DC 20551. For the hearing impaired and users of 
TTY-TRS, please call 711 from any telephone, anywhere in the United 
States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 19(b)(2) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
461(b)(2)) requires each depository institution to maintain reserves 
against its transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits, as 
prescribed by Board regulations, for the purpose of implementing 
monetary policy. The Board's actions with respect to this provision are 
discussed below.

I. Reserve Requirements

    Section 19(b) of the Act authorizes different ranges of reserve 
requirement ratios depending on the amount of transaction account 
balances at a depository institution. Section 19(b)(11)(A) of the Act 
(12 U.S.C. 461(b)(11)(A)) provides that a zero percent reserve 
requirement ratio shall apply at each depository institution to total 
reservable liabilities that do not exceed a certain amount, known as 
the reserve requirement exemption amount. Section 19(b)(11)(B) provides 
that, before December 31 of each year, the Board shall issue a 
regulation adjusting the reserve requirement exemption amount for the 
next calendar year if total reservable liabilities held at all 
depository institutions increase from one year to the next. No 
adjustment is made to the reserve requirement exemption amount if total 
reservable liabilities held at all depository institutions should 
decrease during the applicable time period. The Act requires the 
percentage increase in the reserve requirement exemption amount to be 
80 percent of the percentage increase in total reservable liabilities 
of all depository institutions over the one-year period that ends on 
the June 30 prior to the adjustment.
    Total reservable liabilities of all depository institutions 
increased by 14.1 percent, from $18,123 billion to $20,678 billion, 
between June 30, 2021, and June 30, 2022.\1\ Accordingly, the Board is 
amending Regulation D to set the reserve requirement exemption amount 
for 2023 at $36.1 million, an increase of $3.7 million from its level 
in 2022.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The June 30th value for 2021 may differ from the value used 
in the previous year's calculation because depository institutions 
may revise their deposit data to correct for inaccuracies.
    \2\ Consistent with Board practice, the low reserve tranche and 
reserve requirement exemption amounts have been rounded to the 
nearest $0.1 million.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 461(b)(2)), 
transaction account balances maintained at each depository institution 
over the reserve requirement exemption amount and up to a certain 
amount, known as the low reserve tranche, may be subject to a reserve 
requirement ratio of not more than 3 percent (and which may be zero). 
Transaction account balances over the low reserve tranche may be 
subject to a reserve requirement ratio of not more than 14 percent (and 
which may be zero). Section 19(b)(2) also provides that, before 
December 31 of each year,

[[Page 73634]]

the Board shall issue a regulation adjusting the low reserve tranche 
for the next calendar year. The Act requires the adjustment in the low 
reserve tranche to be 80 percent of the percentage increase or decrease 
in total transaction accounts of all depository institutions over the 
one-year period that ends on the June 30 prior to the adjustment.
    Net transaction accounts of all depository institutions increased 
10.0 percent, from $15,813 billion to $17,390 billion, between June 30, 
2021, and June 30, 2022.\3\ Accordingly, the Board is amending 
Regulation D to set the low reserve tranche for net transaction 
accounts for 2023 at $691.7 million, an increase of $51.1 million from 
2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The June 30th value for 2021 may differ from the value used 
in the previous year's calculation because depository institutions 
may revise their deposit data to correct for inaccuracies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The new reserve requirement exemption amount and low reserve 
tranche will be effective for all depository institutions beginning 
January 1, 2023.
    Effective March 26, 2020, the Board reduced reserve requirement 
ratios on all net transaction accounts to zero percent, eliminating 
reserve requirements for all depository institutions. The annual 
indexation of the reserve requirement exemption amount and the low 
reserve tranche for 2023 is required by statute but will not affect 
depository institutions' reserve requirements, which will remain zero.

II. Regulatory Analysis

Administrative Procedure Act

    The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) relating to notice of proposed 
rulemaking have not been followed in connection with the adoption of 
these amendments. The amendments involve expected, ministerial 
adjustments prescribed by statute and by the Board's policy concerning 
reporting practices. The adjustments in the reserve requirement 
exemption amount and the low reserve tranche serve to reduce regulatory 
burdens on depository institutions. Accordingly, the Board finds good 
cause for determining, and so determines, that notice in accordance 
with 5 U.S.C. 553(b) is unnecessary.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) does not apply to a rulemaking 
where a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required.\4\ As 
noted previously, the Board has determined that it is unnecessary to 
publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking for this final rule. 
Accordingly, the RFA's requirements relating to an initial and final 
regulatory flexibility analysis do not apply.

    \4\ 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995,\5\ the 
Board reviewed this final rule. No collections of information pursuant 
to the Paperwork Reduction Act are contained in the final rule.
