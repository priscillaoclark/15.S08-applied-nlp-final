DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

Office of the Secretary

31 CFR Part 1

 
Privacy Act; Implementation

AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 
1974, as amended, the Department of the Treasury gives notice of a 
final rule to exempt an Internal Revenue Service system of records 
entitled ``Treasury/IRS 42.002--Excise Compliance Programs'' from 
certain provisions of the Privacy Act.

DATES: Effective Date: March 25, 2008.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Telephonic inquiries should be 
directed to David Silverman, Tax Law Specialist, Internal Revenue 
Service at (202) 283-7382.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of the Treasury published a 
notice of a proposed rule exempting a system of records from certain 
provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. The Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) published the Privacy Act system of records notice in its 
entirety on November 8, 2006, at 71 FR 65570, and the proposed rule on 
November 9, 2006 at 71 FR 65763.
    Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the head of an agency may promulgate 
rules to exempt any system of records within the agency from certain 
provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, if the system is 
investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes. Treasury/
IRS 42.002--Excise Compliance Programs contains investigatory material 
compiled for law enforcement purposes.
    The proposed rule requested that public comments be sent to the 
Office of Governmental Liaison and Disclosure, 1111 Constitution 
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20224, no later than December 11, 2006.
    The IRS did not receive comments on the proposed rule. Accordingly, 
the Department of the Treasury is hereby giving notice that the system 
of records entitled ``Treasury/IRS 42.002--Excise Compliance Programs'' 
is exempt from certain provisions of the Privacy Act.
    The provisions of the Privacy Act from which the system of records 
is exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) are as follows: 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3), (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H) and 
(e)(4)(I), and (f).
    As required by Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that 
this proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action, and 
therefore, does not require a regulatory impact analysis.
    The regulation will not have a substantial direct effect on the 
States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the 
various levels of government. Therefore, it is determined that this 
final rule does not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 
U.S.C. 601-612, it is hereby certified that these regulations will not 
significantly affect a substantial number of small entities. The final 
rule imposes no duties or obligations on small entities.
    In accordance with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995, the Department of the Treasury has determined that this final 
rule would not impose new record keeping, application, reporting, or 
other types of information collection requirements.
