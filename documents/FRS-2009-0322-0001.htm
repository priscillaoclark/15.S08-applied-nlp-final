FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

12 CFR Part 229

[Regulation CC; Docket No. R-1376]

 
Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks

AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

ACTION: Final rule; technical amendment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Board of Governors (Board) is amending the routing number 
guide to next-day availability checks and local checks in Regulation CC 
to delete the reference to the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Philadelphia and to reassign the Federal Reserve routing symbols 
currently listed under that office to the head office of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Cleveland. These amendments reflect the restructuring 
of check-processing operations within the Federal Reserve System.

DATES: The final rule will become effective on December 12, 2009.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeffrey S. H. Yeganeh, Financial 
Services Manager (202/728-5801), or Joseph P. Baressi, Financial 
Services Project Leader (202/452-3959), Division of Reserve Bank 
Operations and Payment Systems; or Dena L. Milligan, Attorney (202/452-
3900), Legal Division. For users of Telecommunications Devices for the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulation CC establishes the maximum period 
a depositary bank may wait between receiving a deposit and making the 
deposited funds available for withdrawal.\1\ A depositary bank 
generally must provide faster availability for funds deposited by a 
``local check'' than by a ``nonlocal check.'' A check is considered 
local if it is payable by or at or through a bank located in the same 
Federal Reserve check-processing region as the depositary bank.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For purposes of Regulation CC, the term ``bank'' refers to 
any depository institution, including commercial banks, savings 
institutions, and credit unions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Appendix A to Regulation CC contains a routing number guide that 
assists banks in identifying local and nonlocal banks and thereby 
determining the maximum permissible hold periods for most deposited 
checks. The appendix includes a list of each Federal Reserve check-
processing office and the first four digits of the routing number, 
known as the Federal Reserve routing symbol, of each bank that is 
served by that office for check-processing purposes. Banks whose 
Federal Reserve routing symbols are grouped under the same office are 
in the same check-processing region and thus are local to one another.
    On December 12, 2009, the Reserve Banks will transfer the check-
processing operations of the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Philadelphia to the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Cleveland. As a result of this change, some checks that are drawn on 
and deposited at banks located in the Philadelphia and Cleveland check-
processing regions and that currently are nonlocal checks will become 
local checks subject to faster availability schedules. To assist banks 
in identifying local and nonlocal checks and making funds availability 
decisions, the Board is amending the lists of routing symbols in 
appendix A associated with the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia 
and Cleveland to reflect the transfer of check-processing operations 
from the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to the 
head office of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. To coincide with 
the effective date of the underlying check-processing changes, the 
amendments to appendix A are effective December 12, 2009. The Board is 
providing notice of the amendments at this time to give affected banks 
ample time to make any needed processing changes. Early notice also 
will enable affected banks to amend their availability schedules and 
related disclosures if necessary and provide their customers with 
notice of these changes.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Section 229.18(e) of Regulation CC requires that banks 
notify account holders who are consumers within 30 days after 
implementing a change that improves the availability of funds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Administrative Procedure Act

    The public comment requirements of section 553(b) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act do not apply to these amendments to 
Appendix A of Regulation CC because the amendments involve matters of 
agency organization. The Monetary Control Act requires cost recovery 
for Federal Reserve Bank priced services over the long term, which from 
time to time necessitates changes in the internal organization of 
Reserve Bank services in order to meet the statutory mandate. The rapid 
decline in paper check volumes, generally, and the decline in paper 
checks sent to the Reserve Banks for collection have significantly 
reduced the need for Federal Reserve check-processing locations and the 
ability of Reserve Banks to recover the costs of maintaining those 
locations. In order to achieve the Monetary Control Act requirement of 
long-run full cost recovery, the Reserve Banks have adjusted their 
check service infrastructure to reduce the number of check-processing 
regions. In light of the fact that the Reserve Banks are receiving a 
high percentage of checks electronically, the consolidation of check 
processing centers and the accompanying amendments to Appendix A of 
Regulation CC are required by law. As a result of the consolidation of 
Federal Reserve check-processing offices, amendments to Appendix A are 
necessary because the statutory and regulatory terms ``local'' and 
``nonlocal'' are defined in terms of ``check-processing regions''--the 
geographic areas served by a Federal Reserve check-processing office.
    In addition, the Board finds, in accordance with APA section 
553(d), good cause for making the amendments to Appendix A relating to 
the transfer of check-processing operations from Philadelphia to 
Cleveland effective without 30 days advance publication. On October 14, 
2009, the Federal Reserve Banks, by letter, informed depository 
institutions within Philadelphia's check-processing region of the 
December 12 transfer of check-

[[Page 58538]]

processing operations from Philadelphia to Cleveland. That letter was 
then published on the Federal Reserve Financial Services' website. 
Accordingly, the affected depository institutions are aware of and 
making preparations for the transfer of paper check-processing 
operations from Philadelphia to Cleveland.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
3506; 5 CFR Part 1320 Appendix A.1), the Board has reviewed the final 
rule under authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management 
and Budget. The technical amendments to appendix A of Regulation CC 
will delete the reference to the head office of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Philadelphia and reassign the routing symbols listed under that 
office to the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. The 
depository institutions that are located in the affected check-
processing regions and that include the routing numbers in their 
disclosure statements would be required to notify customers of the 
resulting change in availability under Sec.  229.18(e). However, all 
paperwork collection procedures associated with Regulation CC already 
are in place, and the Board accordingly anticipates that no additional 
burden will be imposed as a result of this rulemaking.
