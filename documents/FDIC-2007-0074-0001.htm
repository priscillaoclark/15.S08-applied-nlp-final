FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION

12 CFR Part 308

RIN 3064-AD22

 
Rules of Practice and Procedure

AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is amending 
its procedural regulations implementing sections 8(g) and 8(b) of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The amendments are generally technical 
in nature, and are necessary to ensure that the rules are consistent 
with statutory changes effected by sections 708 and 702 of the 
Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006.

DATES: Effective Date: November 28, 2007.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background

    On October 13, 2006, the President signed into law Public Law 109-
351, the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 (FSRRA). 
Section 708 of the FSRRA modified section 8(g) of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act (FDI Act), in a number of ways.
    On August 9, 1991, the FDIC issued a final rule entitled ``Rules of 
Practice and Procedure.'' 56 FR 37975, August 9, 1991. This rule 
contained a Subpart N, entitled ``Rules and Procedures Applicable to 
Proceedings Relating to Suspension, Removal, and Prohibition Where a 
Felony is Charged,'' which included sections 308.161-308.164. Section 
708 of FSRRA made various modifications to section 8(g) of the FDI Act 
to clarify the extent of the suspension, removal and prohibition 
authority of the Federal banking agencies in cases of certain crimes by 
institution-affiliated parties (IAPs). Minor modifications were made to 
the predicate and findings requirements of section 8(g)(1), as well as 
conforming amendments to sections 8(g)(2) and (3). Significantly, 
section 8(g)(1) was modified to clarify that the appropriate Federal 
banking agency may suspend or prohibit individuals who are the subject 
of criminal proceedings involving certain crimes from participation in 
the affairs of any depository institution, not only the depository 
institution with which the IAP is or was associated.
    In addition, because the previous suspension language of section 
8(g) had required findings specific to the depositors of the depository 
institution or to the depository institution itself, it was unclear 
whether a covered individual could be suspended if the institution had 
ceased to exist. This problem was addressed by directing the required 
findings to ``any relevant depository institution,'' which is defined 
in a new subsection (E) to mean any depository institution of which the 
party is or was an IAP at the time the information, indictment, 
complaint, suspension notice or order of prohibition is issued.
    Since much of the language of section 8(g) is repeated in the 
FDIC's implementing regulations at Part 308, Subpart N--Rules and 
Procedures Applicable to Proceedings Relating to Suspension, Removal, 
and Prohibition Where a Felony is Charged, 12 CFR 308.161-164, numerous 
conforming amendments of the regulations are required. Finally, a few 
changes are made in order to standardize references contained in the 
various sections and to make the hearing procedures easier to 
understand and to conform with current practice and procedure.
    Section 702 of FSRRA enacted a new section 50 of the FDI Act, 
codified at 12 U.S.C. 1831aa, entitled ``Enforcement of Agreements.'' 
Subsection (a) of the new section 50 provides that:
    ``Notwithstanding clause (i) or (ii) of section 8(b)(6)(A) or 
section 38(e)(2)(E)(i), the appropriate Federal banking agency for a 
depository institution may enforce, under section 8, the terms of--
    (1) Any condition imposed in writing by the agency on the 
depository institution or an institution-affiliated party in connection 
with any action on

[[Page 67234]]

any application, notice, or other request concerning the depository 
institution; or
    (2) Any written agreement entered into between the agency and the 
depository institution or an institution-affiliated party.''
    On August 9, 1991, the FDIC issued a final rule entitled ``Rules of 
Practice and Procedure.'' 56 FR 37975, August 9, 1991. This rule 
contained a Subpart G, entitled ``Rules and Procedures Applicable to 
Proceedings Relating to Cease-and-Desist Orders'' which included 
section 308.127, entitled ``Scope.'' Section 308.127(a) described the 
scope of rules applicable to cease-and-desist proceedings under section 
8(b) of the FDI Act. Because the new section 50 modifies the 
requirements for pursuit of affirmative action under section 8(b)(6), 
it is appropriate that the procedural regulations respecting pursuit of 
cease-and-desist actions be amended to reflect the applicability of the 
new section 50. Accordingly, the final rule modifies the procedural 
regulations with the addition of a cross-reference to the new section 
50.

II. The Final Rule

    The following is a section-by-section discussion of the final rule 
revisions to the FDIC's regulations.

Section 308.161--Scope

    The proposed rule: (1) Revises the scope of the prohibition from 
``the bank'' to ``any depository institution;'' and (2) revises the 
description of the predicate offenses and the required findings to 
reflect statutory changes to section 8(g). The predicate offense 
description changed from ``is charged in any state or federal 
information, indictment, or complaint, with the commission of or 
participation in'' to ``is the subject of any state or federal 
information, indictment, or complaint, involving the commission of or 
participation in.'' The required findings changed from ``if continued 
service or participation by such party poses a threat to the interests 
of the bank's depositors or threatens to impair public confidence in 
the depository institution'' to ``if continued service or participation 
by such party posed, poses, or may pose a threat to the interests of 
the depositors of, or threatened, threatens, or may threaten to impair 
public confidence in, any relevant depository institution.''

Section 308.162--Relevant Considerations

    The proposed rule: (1) clarifies that the considerations apply to a 
notice of suspension or prohibition, or a removal or prohibition order; 
and (2) revises the required findings recited in subsection (a)(1)(iii) 
to reflect the statutory changes to section 8(g).

Section 308.163--Notice of Suspension, and Orders of Removal and 
Prohibition

    The proposed rule: (1) Revises the title of the section to read 
``Notice of suspension or prohibition, and orders of removal or 
prohibition;'' (2) revises the scope of the prohibition from ``the 
bank'' to ``any depository institution'' in subsections (a)(1) and 
(b)(1); revises the required findings in subsection (b)(1); (3) 
corrects the cross reference in subsection (b)(2) from 308.161(a)(ii) 
to 308.161(a)(2); and moves subsection (a)(2) respecting the filing and 
content of requests for hearing to a new subsection (c) to make clear 
that there is a right to a hearing regarding both notices of suspension 
and prohibition and orders of removal and prohibition.

Section 308.164--Hearings

    The proposed rule: (1) Eliminates confusion by changing references 
to the party filing the request for hearing from the ``applicant'' to 
the ``institution-affiliated party;'' (2) eliminates confusion in 
subsection (c) caused by the apparent ability of the bank to waive a 
hearing even if the affected individual were to request a hearing; (3) 
in subsections (d) and (e) makes it clear that there is a right to a 
hearing regarding both notices of suspension and prohibition and orders 
of removal and prohibition.

Section 308.127--Scope Subpart G

    The final rule: (1) Revises the heading for section 308.127(a) from 
``Cease-and-desist proceedings under section 8 of the FDIA ``Cease-and-
desist proceeding under sections 8 and 50 of the FDIA;'' and (2) at the 
end of section 308.127(a), replaces the period with a comma and adds 
``and section 50 of the FDIA, 12 U.S.C. 1831aa.''

III. Exemption From Public Notice and Comment

    The revisions to part 308 do not constitute a ``rule'' for which 
the FDIC is required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking 
under section 553(b) of Title 5 of the United States Code. This is 
because the final rule contains only clarifications and technical 
changes intended to bring the agency's rules of practice and procedure 
into conformity with statutory changes and current agency practices and 
procedures. Thus, the changes to be implemented will have no adverse 
effect on the public. In addition, the FSRRA changes to the FDI Act 
took effect on October 13, 2006. It is, therefore, desirable to 
implement the necessary technical and conforming regulatory amendments 
as soon as possible. Thus, the FDIC has determined for good cause that 
public notice and comment are unnecessary, and that the rule should be 
published in final form.

IV. Paperwork Reduction Act

    The proposed rule will not create or modify any collections of 
information pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et 
seq.). Consequently, no information has been submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget for review.

V. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires an 
agency to publish an initial regulatory flexibility analysis, except to 
the extent provided in 5 U.S.C. 605(b), whenever the agency is required 
to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking for a proposed rule. 
For the reasons discussed above, the FDIC is publishing this rule as a 
final rule, for which no publication of a general notice of proposed 
rulemaking is necessary. No regulatory flexibility analysis is 
required.

VI. The Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999--
Assessment of Federal Regulations and Policies on Families

    The FDIC has determined that the proposed rule will not affect 
family well-being within the meaning of section 654 of the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations Act, enacted as part of the Omnibus 
Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 
(Pub. L. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681).

VII. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act

    The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 
(SBREFA) (Title II, Pub. L. 104-121) provides generally for agencies to 
report rules to Congress and the General Accounting Office (GAO) for 
review. The reporting requirement is triggered when a federal agency 
issues a final rule. The FDIC will file the appropriate reports with 
Congress and the GAO as required by SBREFA. The Office of Management 
and Budget has determined that the proposed rule does not constitute a 
``major rule'' as defined by SBREFA.

VIII. Effective Date

    The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) provides 
that regulations shall become effective thirty (30) days after their 
publication in the

[[Page 67235]]

Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 553). One exception to this requirement is 
for a finding of ``good cause'' (Id. At 553(d)). For the final rule, 
the Board finds ``good cause'' to make the amendments effective 
immediately upon publication in the Federal Register because the 
amendments are technical and conforming to pre-existing statutory and 
regulatory requirements.

full force and effect pursuant to Sec.  308.163.
    (e) Decision by Board of Directors or its designee. Within 60 days
