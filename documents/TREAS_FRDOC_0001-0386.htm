SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background

    In order to improve the effectiveness of CMPs and to maintain their 
deterrent effect, the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
of 1990, 28 U.S.C. 2461 note (``the Inflation Adjustment Act''), as 
amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
Improvements Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114-74) (``the 2015 Act''), requires 
Federal agencies to adjust each CMP provided by law within the 
jurisdiction of the agency. The 2015 Act requires agencies to adjust 
the level of CMPs with an initial ``catch-up'' adjustment through an 
interim final rulemaking and to make subsequent annual adjustments for 
inflation, without needing to provide notice and the opportunity for 
public comment required by 5 U.S.C. 553. The Department's initial 
catch-up adjustment interim final rules were published on December 7, 
2016 (Departmental Offices) (81 FR 88600), and for 31 CFR part 27, on 
February 11, 2019 (84 FR 3105). The Department's 2018 annual adjustment 
was published on March 19, 2018 (83 FR 11876), the Department's 2019 
annual adjustment was published on April 17, 2019 (84 FR 15955), and 
the Department's 2020 annual adjustment was published on February 21, 
2020 (85 FR 10063). This rule constitutes the Department's 2021 annual 
adjustment. The 2015 Act provides that any increase in a CMP shall 
apply to CMPs that are assessed after the date the increase takes 
effect, regardless of whether the underlying violation predated such 
increase.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ However, the increased CMPs apply only with respect to 
underlying violations occurring after the date of enactment of the 
2015 Act, i.e., after November 2, 2015.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This rule also amends regulations that provide civil penalties for 
false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or written statements under the 
Department's Regulations Implementing the Program Fraud Civil Remedies 
Act of 1986, at 31 CFR part 16. Adjustments to CMPs under that Part 
were inadvertently omitted from the Department's initial catch-up 
adjustment and its subsequent annual adjustments. In particular, this 
rule adjusts for inflation the maximum amount of the civil monetary 
penalties that may be assessed under 31 CFR part 16, and it updates the 
inflation adjustments through 2021 in accordance with instructions from 
the Office of Management and Budget.
    Treasury is currently authorized to impose CMPs against persons who 
make false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or who make false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent written statements, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 
3802(a). The maximum CMPs under this statute were established on 
October 21, 1986, and they have not been adjusted. The maximum CMPs 
established were $5,000 for each qualifying false claim or false 
written statement.

II. Method of Calculation

    The method of calculating CMP adjustments applied in this final 
rule is required by the 2015 Act. Under the 2015 Act and the Office of 
Management and Budget guidance required by the 2015 Act, annual 
inflation adjustments subsequent to the initial catch-up adjustment are 
to be based on the percent change between the Consumer Price Index for 
all Urban Consumers (``CPI-U'') for the October preceding the date of 
the adjustment and the prior year's October CPI-U. As set forth in 
Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-21-10 of December 23, 
2020, the adjustment multiplier for 2021 is 1.01182. In order to 
complete the 2021 annual adjustment, each current CMP is multiplied by 
the 2021 adjustment multiplier. Under the 2015 Act, any increase in CMP 
must be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1.
    With regard to the CMPs authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3802(a), 
adjustments had to be made back to 2016. Pursuant to OMB Guidance, the 
relevant inflation factor is 2.15628 for the initial catch-up 
adjustment. Because application of the factor would result in an 
adjustment of greater than 150% for both 31 U.S.C. 3802(a) CMPs, the 
initial adjustment of these penalties is limited to 150%. The relevant 
inflation factors for 2017 through 2021 are 1.01636 (2017), 1.02041 
(2018), 1.02522 (2019), 1.01764 (2020), and 1.01182 (2021).\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ OMB Memoranda regarding the initial catch-up and yearly 
inflation adjustments include M-16-06 (Feb. 24, 2016), M-17-11 (Dec. 
16, 2016), M-18-03 (Dec. 15, 2017), M-19-04 (Dec. 14, 2018), M-20-05 
(Dec. 16, 2019), and M-21-10 (Dec. 23, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to the $5,000 CMPs, applying the initial 150% 
adjustment would result in a maximum penalty amount of $7,500. 
Multiplying that amount by the 2017 factor of 1.01636 and rounding to 
the nearest dollar would yield a maximum penalty amount of $7,623. 
Multiplying that amount by the 2018 factor of 1.02041 and rounding 
yields a maximum penalty amount of $7,779. Multiplying that amount by 
the 2019 factor of 1.02522 and rounding yields a maximum penalty amount 
of $7,975. Multiplying that amount by the 2020 factor of 1.01764 and 
rounding yields a maximum penalty amount of $8,116. Finally, applying 
the 2021 factor of 1.01182 to that amount results in an adjusted 
maximum penalty of $8,212.

Procedural Matters

1. Administrative Procedure Act

    The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements 
Act of 2015 (Section 701(b)) requires agencies to make annual 
adjustments for inflation to CMPs, without needing to provide notice 
and the opportunity for public comment and a delayed effective date 
required by 5 U.S.C. 553. Additionally, the methodology used for 
adjusting CMPs for inflation is provided by statute, with no discretion 
provided to agencies regarding the substance of the adjustments for 
inflation to CMPs. The Department is charged only with performing 
ministerial computations to determine the dollar amount of adjustments 
for inflation to CMPs. Accordingly, prior public notice, an opportunity 
for public comment, and a delayed effective date are not required for 
this rule, with the exception of the initial catch-up adjustment to 31 
CFR part 16.

2. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply.

[[Page 12539]]

3. Executive Order 12866

    This rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
section 3.f of Executive Order 12866.

4. Paperwork Reduction Act

    The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 
104-13, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR 
part 1320, do not apply to this rule because there are no new or 
revised recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

5. Direct Final Procedures

    Treasury is issuing the amendments to 31 CFR part 16 as a direct 
final rule. The effective date of this rule is May 3, 2021 without 
further notice, unless Treasury receives written adverse comments 
before April 5, 2021.
    If Treasury receives timely written adverse comments on the 
amendments to 31 CFR part 16, Treasury will withdraw the regulation 
before its effective date.
