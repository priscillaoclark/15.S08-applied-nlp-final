Expanded Examination Cycle for Certain Small Insured Depository 
Institutions and U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks

AGENCIES: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC); Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board); Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC); and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), 
Treasury.

ACTION: Interim rules with request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The OCC, Board, FDIC, and OTS (collectively, the Agencies) are 
jointly issuing and requesting public comment on these interim rules to 
implement the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 (FSRRA) 
and related legislation (collectively the Examination Amendments). The 
Examination Amendments permit insured depository institutions 
(institutions) that have up to $500 million in total assets, and that 
meet certain other criteria, to qualify for an 18-month (rather than 
12-month) on-site examination cycle. Prior to enactment of FSRRA, only 
institutions with less than $250 million in total assets were eligible 
for an 18-month on-site examination

cycle. The OCC, Board, and FDIC are making parallel changes to their 
regulations governing the on-site examination cycle for U.S. branches 
and agencies of foreign banks (foreign bank offices), consistent with 
the International Banking Act of 1978 (IBA). In addition to 
implementing the changes in the Examination Amendments, the Agencies 
are clarifying when a small insured depository institution is 
considered ``well managed'' for purposes of qualifying for an 18-month 
examination cycle.

DATES: These interim rules are effective on April 10, 2007. Comments on 
the rules must be received by May 10, 2007.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    Section 10(d) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDI Act) 
\1\ generally requires that the appropriate federal banking agency for 
an insured depository institution conduct a full-scope, on-site 
examination of the institution at least once during each 12-month 
period. Prior to enactment of FSRRA, section 10(d) also authorized the 
appropriate federal banking agency to lengthen the on-site examination 
cycle for an institution to 18 months if the institution (1) had total 
assets of less than $250 million; (2) was well capitalized (as defined 
in the prompt corrective action statute at 12 U.S.C. 1831o); (3) was 
found, at its most recent examination, to be well managed and to have a 
composite condition of outstanding or good; \2\ (4) had not undergone a 
change in control during the previous 12-month period in which a full-
scope, on-site examination otherwise would have been required; and (5) 
was not subject to a formal enforcement proceeding or order by its 
appropriate federal banking agency or the FDIC. The Board, the FDIC and 
the OTS, as the appropriate federal banking agencies for state-
chartered insured banks and savings associations, are permitted to 
conduct on-site examinations of such institutions on alternating 12-
month or 18-month schedules with the institution's State supervisor, if 
the Board, FDIC, or OTS, as appropriate, determines that the 
alternating examination conducted by the State carries out the purposes 
of section 10(d) of the FDI Act and the Home Owners' Loan Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Section 10(d) of the FDI Act was added by section 111 of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 
(FDICIA) and is codified at 12 U.S.C. 1820(d).
    \2\ Under section 10(d) of the FDI Act, before enactment of the 
Examination Amendments, the Agencies had the authority to extend the 
18-month examination cycle to institutions with composite CAMELS 
ratings of 2 and assets of up to $250 million. Section 10(d) 
required that the Agencies determine that extending the 18-month 
cycle in this manner would be consistent with safety and soundness. 
See 12 U.S.C. 1820(d)(10). The Agencies exercised this discretion in 
1997 and extended the 18-month examination cycle to 2-rated 
institutions with assets of $250 million or less. See 62 FR 6449, 
February 12, 1997 (interim rule); see also 63 FR 16377, April 2, 
1998 (final rule).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, section 7(c)(1)(C) of the IBA provides that a U.S. 
branch or agency of a foreign bank shall be subject to on-site 
examination by its appropriate federal banking agency as frequently as 
a national or state bank would be subject to such an examination by the 
agency. The agencies previously adopted regulations to implement the 
examination cycle requirements of section 10(d) of the FDI Act and 
section 7(c)(1)(C) of the IBA, including the extended 18-month 
examination cycle available to qualifying small institutions and 
foreign bank offices.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See 12 CFR 4.6 and 4.7 (OCC), 12 CFR 208.64 and 211.26 
(Board), 12 CFR 337.12 and 347.211 (FDIC), and 12 CFR 563.171 (OTS).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 605 of FSRRA, which became effective on October 13, 2006, 
amended section 10(d) of the FDI Act to raise, from $250 million to 
$500 million, the total asset threshold below which an insured 
depository institution may qualify for an 18-month (rather than a 12-
month) on-site examination cycle.\4\ Public Law No. 109-473, which 
became effective on January 11, 2007, also amended section 10(d)(10) of 
the FDI Act to authorize the appropriate agency, if it determines the 
action would be consistent with principles of safety and soundness, to 
allow an insured depository institution that falls within this expanded 
total asset threshold to qualify for an 18-month examination cycle if 
the institution received a composite rating of outstanding or good at 
its most recent examination.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Pub. L. No. 109-351, 120 Stat. 1966 (2006).
    \5\ 120 Stat. 3561 (2007).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Examination Amendments will allow the Agencies to better focus 
their supervisory resources on those institutions that may present 
capital, managerial, or other issues of supervisory concern, while 
concomitantly reducing the regulatory burden on small, well capitalized 
and well managed institutions. The Agencies will continue to use off-
site monitoring tools to identify potential problems in smaller, well 
capitalized and well managed institutions that present low levels of 
risk. Moreover, neither the statute nor the Agencies' regulations 
limit, and the Agencies therefore retain, the authority to examine an 
insured depository institution or foreign bank office more frequently 
than would be required by the FDI Act or IBA.

Description of the Interim Rules

    The Agencies are adopting interim rules to implement the 
Examination Amendments. In particular, the Agencies are amending their 
respective rules to raise, from $250 million to $500 million, the total 
asset threshold below which an insured depository institution that 
meets the qualifying criteria in section 10(d) and the Agencies' rules 
may qualify for an 18-month on-site examination cycle. In addition, as 
authorized by the Examination Amendments, the Agencies have determined 
that it is consistent with safety and soundness to permit institutions 
with between $250 million and $500 million in total assets that 
received a composite rating of 1 or 2 under the Uniform Financial 
Institutions Rating System (commonly referred to as CAMELS),\6\ and 
that meet

[[Page 17801]]

the other qualifying criteria set forth in section 10(d) and the 
Agencies' rules, to qualify for an 18-month examination cycle. In this 
regard, data indicate that between 1985 and 2000, insured depository 
institutions with a composite CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 were more than 
three times less likely to fail over the next five-year period than 
institutions with a lower composite CAMELS rating. Furthermore, the 
Agencies note that, in order to qualify for an 18-month examination 
cycle, any insured depository institution with total assets of less 
than $500 million--including one with a composite rating of 2--must 
meet the other capital, managerial and supervisory criteria set forth 
in section 10(d). These provisions, combined with the Agencies' off-
site monitoring activities and ability to examine an institution more 
frequently as necessary or appropriate, have permitted the Agencies to 
effectively supervise and protect the safety and soundness of 
institutions with total assets of $250 million or less since 1997.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ CAMELS is an acronym that is drawn from the first letters of 
the individual components of the rating system: Capital adequacy, 
Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to 
market risk.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Consistent with section 7(c)(1)(C) of the IBA, the OCC, Board and 
FDIC also are making conforming changes to their regulations governing 
the on-site examination cycle for the U.S. branches and agencies of 
foreign banks. The Agencies' amended rules permit a foreign bank office 
with total assets of less than $500 million to qualify for an 18-month 
examination cycle if the office received a composite ROCA rating of 1 
or 2 at its most recent examination.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The four components of the ROCA supervisory rating system 
for foreign bank offices are: Risk management, Operational controls, 
Compliance, and Asset quality.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Agencies estimate that these interim rules will increase the 
number of insured depository institutions that may qualify for an 
extended 18-month examination cycle by approximately 1,089 
institutions, for a total of 6,670 insured depository institutions. 
Approximately 126 foreign branches and agencies would be eligible for 
the extended examination cycle based on the interim rules, for an 
increase of 31 offices.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Data are as of June 30, 2006, and reflect the number of 
institutions and foreign bank offices with total assets of less than 
$500 million.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In connection with these changes, the Agencies also have modified 
their rules to specify, consistent with current practice, that a small 
institution meets the statutory ``well managed'' criteria for an 18-
month cycle if the institution, besides having a CAMELS composite 
rating of 1 or 2, also received a rating of 1 or 2 for the management 
component of the CAMELS rating at its most recent examination. The 
Agencies believe this amendment will provide additional transparency to 
their rules and clarify for institutions how the ``well managed'' 
requirement in section 10(d) is interpreted and applied by the 
Agencies.\9\ This interpretation is consistent with definitions of 
``well managed'' that the Agencies currently apply in other 
circumstances.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ The Agencies' rules relating to the examination cycle for 
foreign bank offices already permit the appropriate Agency to 
consider, among other things, whether the office received a ``3'' or 
lower rating for any of the individual ROCA components (including 
risk management) in determining whether the office should qualify 
for an 18-month exam cycle. See 12 CFR 4.7(b)(2)(i) (OCC), 
211.26(c)(2)(ii) (Board), and 347.211(b)(2)(i) (FDIC).
    \10\ See, e.g., 12 CFR 362.17(c)(1) (FDIC); 12 CFR 5.34(d)(3) 
(OCC); 12 CFR 225.2(5) and 12 CFR 208.11(h) (Board); OTS Examination 
Handbook, Sec. 060 (2004) (OTS).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FDI Act and the IBA set the outside limits within which an on-
site safety and soundness examination of an institution or foreign bank 
office must commence, and permit the appropriate Agency for an 
institution or foreign bank to conduct an on-site examination more 
frequently than required. The Agencies' rules continue to expressly 
recognize that the appropriate Agency may examine an institution or 
foreign bank office as frequently as the Agency deems necessary.

Effective Date/Request for Comment

    The Agencies are issuing these interim rules without advance notice 
and comment and the 30-day delayed effective date ordinarily prescribed 
by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. (``APA''). 
The interim rules implement the provisions of section 605 of the FSRRA, 
which became effective on October 13, 2006, and Public Law No. 109-473, 
which became effective on January 11, 2007. The interim rules adopt 
without change the statutory increase in the asset ceiling for 18-month 
examination of CAMELS-1 rated institutions and the statutory 
availability of the 18-month examination cycle for CAMELS-2 
institutions. The interim rules also explain how the Agencies apply the 
``well managed'' requirement in the underlying statute and thus, 
provide greater clarity to institutions consistent with the agencies' 
current practices. For these reasons, the Agencies find there is good 
cause to issue the rules without advance notice and comment. 5 U.S.C. 
553(b)(3)(A), (B). The rules explain how the Agencies generally 
exercise the discretion given them by the statute to examine qualifying 
institutions less frequently than once every 12 months. The Agencies 
retain the discretion to examine individual institutions more 
frequently; the interim rules do not bind the Agencies to examine 
qualifying institutions on an 18-month basis, nor do they create a 
right for institutions to be examined on an 18-month cycle. With 
respect to the delayed effective date, the Agencies conclude that, 
because the rules recognize an exemption, the interim rules are exempt 
from the APA's delayed effective date requirement. 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1). 
The Agencies are nevertheless interested in the views of the public and 
request comment on all aspects of these interim rules.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The interim rules do not impose any new obligations, restrictions 
or burdens on banking organizations, including small banking 
organizations, and, indeed, reduce regulatory burden associated with 
on-site examinations for qualifying small institutions and foreign bank 
offices. For these reasons, the Agencies certify that the interim rules 
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small 
entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 5 U.S.C. 601 et 
seq. The objective and legal basis for the interim rules are discussed 
in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995,\11\ the 
Agencies have determined that no collections of information pursuant to 
the Paperwork Reduction Act are contained in these interim rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OCC and OTS Executive Order 12866 Statement

    The OCC and OTS have each independently determined that the interim 
rules with request for comment are not significant regulatory actions 
under Executive Order 12866.

OCC and OTS Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995 Statement

    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\12\ 
requires that an agency prepare a budgetary impact statement before 
promulgating a rule that includes a federal mandate that may result in 
the expenditure by state, local, and tribal governments, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one 
year. If a budgetary impact statement is required, section 205 of the 
Unfunded

[[Page 17802]]

Mandates Act also requires an agency to identify and consider a 
reasonable number of regulatory alternatives before promulgating a 
rule. Because the OCC and the OTS have each independently determined 
that the interim rules will not result in expenditures by state, local, 
and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of 
more than $100 million in any one year, the OCC and the OTS have not 
prepared a budgetary impact statement or specifically addressed the 
regulatory alternatives considered. Nevertheless, as discussed in the 
preamble, the interim rules will have the effect of reducing regulatory 
burden on certain institutions and foreign bank offices.

Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 4809) requires 
the Agencies to use ``plain language'' in all proposed and final rules 
published after January 1, 2000. The Agencies believe the interim rules 
are presented in a clear and straightforward manner and solicit 
comments on ways to make the rules easier to understand.
