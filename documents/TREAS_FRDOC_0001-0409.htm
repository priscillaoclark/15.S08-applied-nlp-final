Emergency Import Restrictions Imposed on Archaeological and 
Ethnological Material of Afghanistan

AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland 
Security; Department of the Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) regulations to reflect the imposition of emergency import 
restrictions on certain archaeological and ethnological material from 
Afghanistan. The Acting Assistant Secretary for Educational and 
Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, determined that 
conditions warrant the imposition of emergency restrictions on 
categories of archaeological material and ethnological material of the 
cultural heritage of Afghanistan. This document contains

[[Page 9440]]

the Designated List of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of 
Afghanistan that describes the types of objects or categories of 
archaeological and ethnological material to which the import 
restrictions apply. The emergency import restrictions imposed on 
certain archaeological and ethnological material of Afghanistan will be 
in effect until April 28, 2026, unless extended. These restrictions are 
being imposed pursuant to determinations of the United States 
Department of State made under the terms of the Convention on Cultural 
Property Implementation Act.

DATES: Effective on February 18, 2022.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, Public Law 
97-446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. (hereinafter, ``the Cultural Property 
Implementation Act'' or ``Act''), implements the 1970 United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention 
on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export 
and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (hereinafter, ``the 
Convention'' (823 U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)). Pursuant to the Cultural 
Property Implementation Act, the United States may enter into 
international agreements with another State Party to the Convention to 
impose import restrictions on eligible archaeological and ethnological 
material under procedures and requirements prescribed by the Act. Under 
certain limited circumstances, the Cultural Property Implementation Act 
authorizes the imposition of import restrictions on an emergency basis 
(19 U.S.C. 2603).
    Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2602(a), on April 28, 2021, Afghanistan, a 
State Party to the Convention, requested that import restrictions be 
imposed on certain archaeological and ethnological material, the 
pillage of which jeopardizes the cultural heritage of Afghanistan. The 
Cultural Property Implementation Act authorizes the President (or 
designee) to apply import restrictions on an emergency basis if the 
President determines that an emergency condition applies with respect 
to any archaeological or ethnological material of any requesting State 
Party (19 U.S.C. 2603). The emergency restrictions are effective for no 
more than five years from the date of the State Party's request and may 
be extended for three years where it is determined that the emergency 
condition continues to apply with respect to the covered material (19 
U.S.C. 2603(c)(3)). These restrictions may also be continued pursuant 
to an agreement concluded within the meaning of the Act (19 U.S.C. 
2603(c)(4)).
    On November 16, 2021, the Acting Assistant Secretary for 
Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, 
after consultation with and recommendation by the Cultural Property 
Advisory Committee, made the determinations necessary under the Act for 
the emergency imposition of import restrictions on certain 
archaeological material and ethnological material of the cultural 
heritage of Afghanistan. The Designated List below sets forth the 
categories of material to which the import restrictions apply. Thus, 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is amending Sec.  12.104g(b) 
of title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 12.104g(b)) 
accordingly.
    Importation of covered material from Afghanistan will be restricted 
until April 28, 2026, unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 
and 19 CFR 12.104c are met.

diverse history, from the 9th century A.D. through A.D. 1920. The
