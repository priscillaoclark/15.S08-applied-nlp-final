SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In June 2009, the Commission proposed 
changes to the federal proxy rules that would require a company, under 
certain circumstances, to include in the company's proxy statement 
disclosure concerning a shareholder's, or group of shareholders', 
nominees for director and to include on the company proxy card the 
names of those nominees.\1\ In addition, the proposed rules would 
require companies to include in their proxy materials, under certain 
circumstances, shareholder proposals that would amend, or that request 
an amendment to, a company's governing documents regarding nomination 
procedures or disclosures related to shareholder nominations, provided 
the shareholder proposal does not conflict with the Commission's 
disclosure rules, including the proposed new rules. The Commission also 
proposed changes to certain of our other rules and regulations, 
including the existing exemptions from the proxy rules and the 
beneficial ownership reporting requirements. The Proposal was published 
for comment in the Federal Register on June 18, 2009, and the initial 
comment period closed on August 17, 2009.
