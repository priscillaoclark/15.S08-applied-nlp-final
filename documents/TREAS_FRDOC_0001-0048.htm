SUMMARY: This document re-opens the period within which comments may be 
submitted in response to the proposed rule to amend the Customs and 
Border Protection (``CBP'') regulations to establish uniform rules

merchandise. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on 
July 25, 2008 (73 FR 43385) with comments due on or before September

Federal Register on September 8, 2008 (73 FR 51962), to October 23, 
2008. This notice re-opens the comment period to afford interested 
parties an opportunity to consider the impact, if any, of the proposed 
rule on the country of origin of their goods in view of the publication 
of a final rule document in today's Federal Register which sets forth 
technical corrections to Sec. Sec.  102.20 and 102.21 of the CBP 
regulations (19 CFR 102.20 and 102.21).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Public Participation

    Interested persons are invited to participate in this rulemaking by 
submitting written data, views, or arguments on all aspects of the 
proposed rule. CBP also invites comments that relate to the economic, 
environmental, or federalism effects that might result from this 
proposed rule. Comments that will provide the most assistance to CBP 
will reference a specific portion of the proposed rule, explain the 
reason for any recommended change, and include data, information, or 
authority that support such recommended change. See ADDRESSES above for 
information on how to submit comments.

Background

    CBP published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal 
Register (73 FR 43385) on July 25, 2008, proposing to amend the CBP 
regulations to establish uniform rules of origin for imported 
merchandise. The proposed rule would extend application of the country 
of origin rules codified in 19 CFR part 102. Those rules have proven to 
be more objective and transparent and provide greater predictability in 
determining the country of origin of imported merchandise than the 
system of case-by-case adjudication they would replace. The proposed 
change also will aid an importer's exercise of reasonable care. In 
addition, the document proposes to amend the country of origin rules 
applicable to pipe fitting and flanges, printed greeting cards, glass 
optical fiber, and rice preparations. Finally, the proposed rule would 
amend the textile regulations set forth in Sec.  102.21 to make 
corrections so that the regulations reflect the language of section 
334(b)(5) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.
    The notice of proposed rulemaking invited the public to comment on 
the proposal. Comments on the proposed rule were requested on or before 
September 23, 2008. In response to the proposed rule published in the 
Federal Register, CBP received correspondence from several parties 
requesting an extension of the comment period. In a notice published in 
the Federal Register on September 8, 2008 (73 FR 51962), CBP provided 
an additional 30 days for interested parties to submit comments on the 
proposed rule until October 23, 2008.

Re-Opening of Comment Period

    As a result of modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTSUS) in 2007, certain tariff provisions have been 
added or removed, and certain goods have been transferred, for tariff 
classification purposes, to different or newly-created provisions. CBP 
is publishing a document in today's Federal Register which sets forth 
technical corrections to Sec. Sec.  102.20 and 102.21 of the CBP 
regulations (19 CFR 102.20 and 102.21) in order to align the 
regulations with the current version of the HTSUS. The technical 
corrections to the tariff shift rules set forth in that document will 
enable parties to properly evaluate the impact, if any, of the proposed 
rule on the country of origin of their goods. Accordingly, in order to 
afford parties the opportunity to enhance their review of the proposed 
rule and provide meaningful comment in light of the technical 
corrections to Sec. Sec.  102.20 and 102.21, the decision has been made 
to re-open the comment period on the proposed rule. Comments are now 
due on or before December 1, 2008.
