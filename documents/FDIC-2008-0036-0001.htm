SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

1. Background

    The FDIC recognizes the importance of financial education programs, 
particularly for those individuals who have little or no experience 
using bank-provided services. Such programs generally contribute to the 
financial stability of individuals, families, and communities. 
Accordingly, the FDIC supports the ongoing efforts of state nonmember 
banks to enhance financial literacy, and continues to encourage 
institutions to collaborate with others members of the community to 
deliver financial education.
    Recently, the FDIC received a number of inquiries as to whether the 
definition of branch includes a school or school facility where a state 
nonmember bank participates or assists in a financial education program 
for the benefit of students. Generally, through such programs, students 
are trained in various banking functions and personal financial 
management. A bank employee may serve as an advisor to the students and 
assist faculty in developing a financial education curriculum.
    In some instances, students provide limited banking services to 
students and faculty directly at the school, on either a part-time 
basis or designated school days. A bank engaged in such a program could 
train students in bank operations and provide general supervision over 
the program and the provision of banking services. These services could 
include opening deposit accounts at the bank for students, faculty and 
parents, and receiving deposits for credit to such accounts. The 
participating bank may also pick up and deliver to its main office or a 
branch any funds received by the students in connection with the 
program. Note that this is not intended to provide an exclusive list of 
permissible activities for banks involved in financial education 
programs.
    Section 18(d)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) 
(Section 18(d)(1)) provides that no state nonmember bank shall 
establish or operate a new domestic branch without the prior written 
consent of the FDIC.\1\ Section 3(o) of the FDI Act (Section 3(o)) 
generally defines a domestic branch to include any branch bank, branch 
office, branch agency, additional office or any branch place of 
business where deposits are received or checks paid or money lent (each 
a core-banking function).\2\ The FDIC has determined by regulation that 
a messenger service that is established and operated by a state 
nonmember bank or its affiliate, which performs one of the core-banking 
functions, is a branch and requires a prior approval pursuant to these 
statutory provisions.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 12 U.S.C. 1828(d)(1).
    \2\ See 12 U.S.C. 1813(o).
    \3\ See 12 CFR 303.41. If, however, the messenger service is 
established or operated by a non-affiliated third party, it 
generally does not constitute a branch for purposes of Section 18(d) 
and FDIC regulations. This interpretation is consistent with a plain 
reading of Section 18(d)(1), and with the decision in Cades v. H & R 
Block, where Justice Butzner, writing for the Fourth Circuit, 
explained that ``courts apply a two-part test to decide whether a 
bank is operating a branch office. First, the court determines 
whether [the] branch is established and operated by the bank. * * 
*'' See 43 F.3d 869, 814 (4th Cir. 1994), citing Independent Bankers 
Ass'n of New York v. Marine Midland Bank, 757 F.2d 453, 456-63 (2d 
Cir 1985); Independent Bankers Ass'n of America v. Smith, 534 F.2d, 
921, 951-52 (DC Cir. 1976). See also First National Bank in Plant 
City v. Dickinson, 396 U.S. 122, 137 n. 10 (1970).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under certain conditions, a bank's participation in a financial 
education program conducted on school premises differs from a bank 
messenger service in that any core-banking function provided in 
connection with such program is (i) provided at the discretion of the 
school; (ii) made available on a limited basis to a discrete group of 
individuals and not to the general public; and (iii)

[[Page 35338]]

conducted and designed primarily for educational purposes. Moreover, 
participating in a financial education program differs from 
establishing a branch because, generally, with respect to such program, 
the facility where banking services are provided is established by the 
school.

2. Interim Final Rule

    This interim final rule exempts from the definition of branch any 
financial education program operated on school premises or a facility 
used by a school, where, in connection with the program, deposits are 
received, checks are paid, or money is lent, subject to certain 
conditions.\4\ As provided in this rule, the principal purpose of the 
financial education program must be educational, and not designed for 
the purpose of profit-making. Further, any banking services provided in 
connection with the program must be provided at the discretion of the 
school. The FDIC expects that such services would be limited in nature; 
available only to students, parents, and faculty; and accessible on a 
part-time basis or designated school days. The bank must monitor the 
program to ensure that it is conducted in a safe and sound manner and 
complies with applicable law.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ This exemption is consistent with a regulation promulgated 
by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2001 which 
exempts from the definition of branch a national bank's 
participation in a financial literacy program conducted on school 
premises. 12 CFR 7.1021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Request for Comments

    The FDIC requests comments on all aspects of this interim final 
rule. Specifically, the FDIC requests comment on whether specific 
controls are needed to ensure the safety and soundness of financial 
education programs conducted on school premises and covered by this 
regulation, for example, rules regarding data and physical security. 
The FDIC also requests comment on whether the scope of, or a bank's 
involvement in, any financial education programs extends beyond the 
activities described in this rule.

Regulatory Analysis and Procedure

A. Administrative Procedure Act

    Section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires 
the FDIC to publish a substantive rule at least 30 days before its 
effective date, unless, under subsection (d)(1), the rule establishes 
or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction.\5\ This interim 
final rule establishes an exemption to the definition of branch 
provided in 12 CFR part 303, subpart C, which has the effect of 
permitting state nonmember banks to participate in certain financial 
education programs conducted on school premises without having to 
submit a branch application to, and receive prior approval from, the 
FDIC. Therefore, the FDIC is not required to publish this interim final 
rule in the Federal Register at least 30 days before its effective 
date.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See 5 U.S.C. 553(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Solicitation of Comments on the Use of Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the federal 
banking agencies to use plain language in all proposed and final rules 
published after January 1, 2000.\6\ We invite your comments on how to 
make this rule easier to understand. For example:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See Pub. L. 106-102, sec. 722, 113 Stat. 1338, 1471 (Nov. 
12, 1999).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Is the material provided in this rule well organized? If not, how 
could this material be better organized?
    Are the requirements in the interim final rule clearly stated? If 
not, how could the rule be more clearly stated?
    Does the rule contain language or jargon that is not clear? If so, 
which language requires clarification?

C. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires an agency that is 
issuing a proposed rule to prepare and make available for public 
comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the 
impact of a proposed rule on small entities.\7\ Because this rulemaking 
does not involve the issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking, the 
requirements of the RFA for a final regulatory flexibility analysis do 
not apply.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See 5 U.S.C. 603(a).
    \8\ See 5 U.S.C. 604.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Paperwork Reduction Act

    The FDIC has determined that this interim final rule does not 
involve a collection of information pursuant to the provisions of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

facility used by the school;
    (b) Such service or services are provided at the discretion of the

principles of personal financial management, banking operations, or the 
benefits of saving for the future, and is not designed for the purpose 
of profit-making; and
    (d) Each program is conducted in a manner that is consistent with 
safe and sound banking practices and complies with applicable law.
