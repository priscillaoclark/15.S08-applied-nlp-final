BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

12 CFR Part 1026


Truth in Lending (Regulation Z) Annual Threshold Adjustments 
(Credit Cards, HOEPA, and Qualified Mortgages)

AGENCY: Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.

ACTION: Final rule; official interpretation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is 
issuing this final rule amending the regulation text and official 
interpretations for Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending 
Act (TILA). The Bureau is required to calculate annually the dollar 
amounts for several provisions in Regulation Z; this final rule 
revises, as applicable, the dollar amounts for provisions implementing 
TILA and amendments to TILA, including under the Credit Card 
Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act), 
the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA), and the 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank 
Act). The Bureau is adjusting these amounts, where appropriate, based 
on the annual percentage change reflected in the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI) in effect on June 1, 2021.

DATES: This final rule is effective January 1, 2022.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Willie Williams, Paralegal Specialist; 
or Lanique Eubanks, Senior Counsel, Office of Regulations, at (202) 
435-7700. If you require this document in an alternative electronic 
format, please contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bcfffaecfee3fddfdfd9cfcfd5ded5d0d5c8c5fcdfdaccde92dbd3ca"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7b383d2b39243a18181e080812191217120f023b181d0b19551c140d">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau is amending the regulation text 
and official interpretations for Regulation Z, which implements TILA, 
to update the dollar amounts of various thresholds that are adjusted 
annually based on the annual percentage change in the CPI as published 
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Specifically, for open-end 
consumer credit plans under TILA, the threshold that triggers 
requirements to disclose minimum interest charges will remain unchanged 
at $1.00 in 2022. For open-end consumer credit plans under the CARD Act 
amendments to TILA, the adjusted dollar amount in 2022 for the safe 
harbor for a first violation penalty fee will increase to $30 and the 
adjusted dollar amount for the safe harbor for a subsequent violation 
penalty fee will increase to $41. For HOEPA loans, the adjusted total 
loan amount threshold for high-cost mortgages in 2022 will be $22,969. 
The adjusted points-and-fees dollar trigger for high-cost mortgages in 
2022 will be $1,148. For qualified mortgages (QMs) under the General QM 
loan definition in Sec.  1026.43(e)(2), the thresholds for the spread 
between the annual percentage rate (APR) and the average prime offer 
rate (APOR) in 2022 will be: 2.25 or more percentage points for a 
first-lien covered transaction with a loan amount greater than or equal 
to $114,847; 3.5 or more percentage points for a first-lien covered 
transaction with a loan amount greater than or equal to $68,908 but 
less than $114,847; 6.5 or more percentage points for a first-lien 
covered transaction with a loan amount less than $68,908; 6.5 or more 
percentage points for a first-lien covered transaction secured by a 
manufactured home with a loan amount less than $114,847; 3.5 or more 
percentage points for a subordinate-lien covered transaction with a 
loan amount greater than or equal to $68,908; or 6.5 or more percentage 
points for a subordinate-lien covered transaction with a loan amount 
less than $68,908. For all categories of QMs, the thresholds for total 
points and

[[Page 60358]]

fees in 2022 will be 3 percent of the total loan amount for a loan 
greater than or equal to $114,847; $3,445 for a loan amount greater 
than or equal to $68,908 but less than $114,847; 5 percent of the total 
loan amount for a loan greater than or equal to $22,969 but less than 
$68,908; $1,148 for a loan amount greater than or equal to $14,356 but 
less than $22,969; and 8 percent of the total loan amount for a loan 
amount less than $14,356.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The QM categories in Regulation Z are as follows: 12 CFR 
1026.43(e)(2), (4), (5), and (6) applies only to covered 
transactions for which the application was received before April 1, 
2016; and (e)(7).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Background

A. Credit Card Annual Adjustments

Minimum Interest Charge Disclosure Thresholds
    Sections 1026.6(b)(2)(iii) and 1026.60(b)(3) of Regulation Z 
implement sections 127(a)(3) and 127(c)(1)(A)(ii)(II) of TILA. Sections 
1026.6(b)(2)(iii) and 1026.60(b)(3) require creditors to disclose any 
minimum interest charge exceeding $1.00 that could be imposed during a 
billing cycle. These provisions also state that, for open-end consumer 
credit plans, the minimum interest charge thresholds will be re-
calculated annually using the CPI that was in effect on the preceding 
June 1; the Bureau uses the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners 
and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for this adjustment.\2\ If the cumulative 
change in the adjusted minimum value derived from applying the annual 
CPI-W level to the current amounts in Sec. Sec.  1026.6(b)(2)(iii) and 
1026.60(b)(3) has risen by a whole dollar, the minimum interest charge 
amounts set forth in the regulation will be increased by $1.00. This 
adjustment analysis is based on the CPI-W index in effect on June 1, 
2021, which was reported by BLS on May 12, 2021,\3\ and reflects the 
percentage change from April 2020 to April 2021. The adjustment 
analysis accounts for a 4.7 percent increase in the CPI-W from April 
2020 to April 2021. This increase in the CPI-W when applied to the 
current amounts in Sec. Sec.  1026.6(b)(2)(iii) and 1026.60(b)(3) does 
not trigger an increase in the minimum interest charge threshold of at 
least $1.00, and the Bureau is therefore not amending Sec. Sec.  
1026.6(b)(2)(iii) and 1026.60(b)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The CPI-W is a subset of the Consumer Price Index for All 
Urban Consumers (CPI-U) index and represents approximately 29 
percent of the U.S. population.
    \3\ BLS publishes Consumer Price Indices monthly, usually in the 
middle of each calendar month. Thus, the CPI-W reported on May 12, 
2021, was the most current as of June 1, 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safe Harbor Penalty Fees
    Section 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of Regulation Z implements 
section 149(e) of TILA, which was added to TILA by the CARD Act.\4\ 
Section 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(D) provides that the safe harbor provision, 
which establishes the permissible penalty fee thresholds in Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (B), will be re-calculated annually using the 
CPI that was in effect on the preceding June 1; the Bureau uses the 
CPI-W for this adjustment. If the cumulative change in the adjusted 
value derived from applying the annual CPI-W level to the current 
amounts in Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) has risen by a whole 
dollar, those amounts will be increased by $1.00. Similarly, if the 
cumulative change in the adjusted value derived from applying the 
annual CPI-W level to the current amounts in Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) 
and (B) has decreased by a whole dollar, those amounts will be 
decreased by $1.00. See comment 52(b)(1)(ii)-2. The 2022 adjustment 
analysis is based on the CPI-W index in effect on June 1, 2021, which 
was reported by BLS on May 12, 2021, and reflects the percentage change 
from April 2020 to April 2021. The permissible fee thresholds increased 
to $30 for a first violation penalty fee and $41 for a subsequent 
violation reflect a 4.7 percent increase in the CPI-W from April 2020 
to April 2021 with the resulting thresholds rounded to the nearest $1 
increment.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. HOEPA Annual Threshold Adjustments

    Section 1026.32(a)(1)(ii) of Regulation Z implements section 1431 
of the Dodd-Frank Act,\5\ which amended the HOEPA points-and-fees 
coverage test. Under Sec.  1026.32(a)(1)(ii)(A) and (B), in assessing 
whether a transaction is a high-cost mortgage due to points and fees 
the creditor is charging, the applicable points-and-fees coverage test 
depends on whether the total loan amount is for $20,000 or more, or for 
less than $20,000. Section 1026.32(a)(1)(ii) provides that this 
threshold amount be recalculated annually using the CPI index in effect 
on the preceding June 1; the Bureau uses the CPI-U for this 
adjustment.\6\ The 2022 adjustment is based on the CPI-U index in 
effect on June 1, which was reported by BLS on May 12, 2021, and 
reflects the percentage change from April 2020 to April 2021. The 
adjustment to $22,969 here reflects a 4.2 percent increase in the CPI-U 
index from April 2020 to April 2021 and is rounded to the nearest whole 
dollar amount for ease of compliance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 
Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).
    \6\ The CPI-U is based on all urban consumers and represents 
approximately 93 percent of the U.S. population.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under Sec.  1026.32(a)(1)(ii)(B) the HOEPA points-and-fees 
threshold is $1,000. Section 1026.32(a)(1)(ii)(B) provides that this 
threshold amount will be recalculated annually using the CPI index in 
effect on the preceding June 1; the Bureau uses the CPI-U for this 
adjustment. The 2022 adjustment is based on the CPI-U index in effect 
on June 1, 2021, which was reported by BLS on May 12, 2021, and 
reflects the percentage change from April 2020 to April 2021. The 
adjustment to $1,148 here reflects a 4.2 percent increase in the CPI-U 
index from April 2020 to April 2021 and is rounded to the nearest whole 
dollar amount for ease of compliance.

C. QM Annual Threshold Adjustments

    The Bureau's Regulation Z implements sections 1411 and 1412 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act, which generally require creditors to make a reasonable, 
good-faith determination of a consumer's ability to repay any consumer 
credit transaction secured by a dwelling and establishes certain 
protections from liability under this requirement for QMs.
    On December 10, 2020, the Bureau issued a final rule amending the 
General QM loan definition in Sec.  1026.43(e)(2).\7\ The final rule 
established pricing thresholds in Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(A) through 
(F) based on the spread of a loan's APR compared to the APOR for a 
comparable transaction as of the date the interest rate is set. To 
satisfy the General QM loan definition, a loan's APR must be below the 
applicable pricing threshold and satisfy other requirements in Sec.  
1026.43(e)(2). Specifically, under Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(vi), a covered 
transaction is a QM if the APR does not exceed the APOR for a 
comparable transaction as of the date the interest rate is set by: 2.25 
or more

[[Page 60359]]

percentage points for a first-lien covered transaction with a loan 
amount greater than or equal to $110,260 (indexed for inflation); 3.5 
or more percentage points for a first-lien covered transaction with a 
loan amount greater than or equal to $66,156 (indexed for inflation) 
but less than $110,260 (indexed for inflation); 6.5 or more percentage 
points for a first-lien covered transaction with a loan amount less 
than $66,156 (indexed for inflation); 6.5 or more percentage points for 
a first-lien covered transaction secured by a manufactured home with a 
loan amount less than $110,260 (indexed for inflation); 3.5 or more 
percentage points for a subordinate-lien covered transaction with a 
loan amount greater than or equal to $66,156 (indexed for inflation); 
or 6.5 or more percentage points for a subordinate-lien covered 
transaction with a loan amount less than $66,156 (indexed for 
inflation).\8\ The rule states that the loan amounts in Sec.  
1026.43(e)(2)(vi) will be adjusted annually on January 1 by the annual 
percentage change in the CPI-U that was in effect on the preceding June 
1.\9\ Section 1026.43(e)(2)(vi) of Regulation Z is also amended to add 
a cross-reference to the official commentary of Regulation Z where 
historical threshold dollar amounts for Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(A) 
through (F) can be located. This change to the regulatory text will 
assist creditors in locating the applicable threshold adjustments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 85 FR 86308 (Dec. 29, 2020). This final rule was initially 
effective on March 1, 2021, with a mandatory compliance date of July 
1, 2021. On April 27, 2021, the Bureau issued a final rule effective 
June 30, 2021, which extended the mandatory compliance date of the 
final rule published on December 29, 2020, at 85 FR 86308, until 
October 1, 2022. 86 FR 22844 (Apr. 30, 2021).
    \8\ The loan amounts in the regulatory text reflect the CPI-U in 
effect on June 1, 2020.
    \9\ See comment 43(e)(2)(vi)-3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Regulation Z also contains points and fees limits applicable to all 
categories of QMs. Under Sec.  1026.43(e)(3)(i), a covered transaction 
is not a QM if the transaction's total points and fees exceed: 3 
percent of the total loan amount for a loan amount greater than or 
equal to $100,000; $3,000 for a loan amount greater than or equal to 
$60,000 but less than $100,000; 5 percent of the total loan amount for 
loans greater than or equal to $20,000 but less than $60,000; $1,000 
for a loan amount greater than or equal to $12,500 but less than 
$20,000; or 8 percent of the total loan amount for loans less than 
$12,500. Section 1026.43(e)(3)(ii) provides that the limits and loan 
amounts in Sec.  1026.43(e)(3)(i) will be recalculated annually for 
inflation using the CPI-U index in effect on the preceding June 1.
    The 2022 adjustment to the loan amounts applicable to the pricing 
thresholds for the General QM loan definition and the points and fees 
limits for all categories of QM is based on the CPI-U index in effect 
on June 1, 2021, which was reported by BLS on May 12, 2021, and 
reflects the percentage change from April 2020 to April 2021. The 
adjustment to the 2021 figures \10\ being adopted here reflects a 4.2 
percent increase in the CPI-U index for this period and is rounded to 
whole dollars for ease of compliance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ For 2022, a covered transaction is a qualified mortgage if 
the APR does not exceed the APOR for a comparable transaction as of 
the date the interest rate is set by: 2.25 or more percentage points 
for a first-lien covered transaction with a loan amount greater than 
or equal to $114,847; 3.5 or more percentage points for a first-lien 
covered transaction with a loan amount greater than or equal to 
$68,908 but less than $114,847; 6.5 or more percentage points for a 
first-lien covered transaction with a loan amount less than $68,908; 
6.5 or more percentage points for a first-lien covered transaction 
secured by a manufactured home with a loan amount less than 
$114,847; 3.5 or more percentage points for a subordinate-lien 
covered transaction with a loan amount greater than or equal to 
$68,908; or 6.5 or more percentage points for a subordinate-lien 
covered transaction with a loan amount less than $68,908. 
Additionally, a covered transaction is not a qualified mortgage if 
the transaction's total points and fees exceed 3 percent of the 
total loan amount for a loan amount greater than or equal to 
$114,847; $3,445 for a loan amount greater than or equal to $68,908 
but less than $114,847; 5 percent of the total loan amount for loans 
greater than or equal to $22,969 but less than $68,908; $1,148 for a 
loan amount greater than or equal to $14,356 but less than $22,969; 
or 8 percent of the total loan amount for loans less than $14,356.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Adjustment and Commentary Revision

A. Credit Card Annual Adjustments

Minimum Interest Charge Disclosure Thresholds--Sec. Sec.  
1026.6(b)(2)(iii) and 1026.60(b)(3)
    The minimum interest charge amounts for Sec. Sec.  
1026.6(b)(2)(iii) and 1026.60(b)(3) will remain unchanged at $1.00 for 
the year 2022. Accordingly, the Bureau is not amending these sections 
of Regulation Z.
Safe Harbor Penalty Fees--Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (B)
    Effective January 1, 2022, the permissible fee threshold amounts 
increased from the amounts for 2021 to $30 for Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and to $41 for Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B). 
Accordingly, the Bureau is amending Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (B). 
The Bureau is amending comment 52(b)(1)(ii)-2.i to preserve a list of 
the historical thresholds for this provision.

B. HOEPA Annual Threshold Adjustment--Comments 32(a)(1)(ii)-1 and -3

    Effective January 1, 2022, for purposes of determining under Sec.  
1026.32(a)(1)(ii) the points-and-fees coverage test under HOEPA to 
which a transaction is subject, the total loan amount threshold is 
$22,969, and the adjusted points-and-fees dollar trigger under Sec.  
1026.32(a)(1)(ii)(B) is $1,148. If the total loan amount for a 
transaction is $22,969 or more, and the points-and-fees amount exceeds 
5 percent of the total loan amount, the transaction is a high-cost 
mortgage. If the total loan amount for a transaction is less than 
$22,969, and the points-and-fees amount exceeds the lesser of the 
adjusted points-and-fees dollar trigger of $1,148 or 8 percent of the 
total loan amount, the transaction is a high-cost mortgage. The Bureau 
is amending comments 32(a)(1)(ii)-1 and -3, which list the adjustments 
for each year, to reflect for 2022 the new points-and-fees dollar 
trigger and the new loan amount dollar threshold, respectively.

C. Qualified Mortgages Annual Threshold Adjustments

    Effective January 1, 2022, to satisfy Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(vi) under 
the General QM loan definition, the APR may not exceed the average 
prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date the 
interest rate is set by the following amounts: 2.25 or more percentage 
points for a first-lien covered transaction with a loan amount greater 
than or equal to $114,847; 3.5 or more percentage points for a first-
lien covered transaction with a loan amount greater than or equal to 
$68,908 but less than $114,847; 6.5 or more percentage points for a 
first-lien covered transaction with a loan amount less than $68,908; 
6.5 or more percentage points for a first-lien covered transaction 
secured by a manufactured home with a loan amount less than $114,847; 
3.5 or more percentage points for a subordinate-lien covered 
transaction with a loan amount greater than or equal to $68,908; or 6.5 
or more percentage points for a subordinate-lien covered transaction 
with a loan amount less than $68,908. Accordingly, the Bureau is 
amending comment 43(e)(2)(vi)-3, which lists the adjustments for each 
year, to reflect the new dollar threshold amounts for Sec.  
1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(A) through (F).
    Effective January 1, 2022, a covered transaction is not a qualified 
mortgage if, pursuant to Sec.  1026.43(e)(3), the transaction's total 
points and fees exceed 3 percent of the total loan amount for a loan 
amount greater than or equal to $114,847; $3,445 for a loan amount 
greater than or equal to $68,908 but less than $114,847; 5 percent of 
the total loan amount for loans greater than or equal to $22,969 but 
less than $68,908; $1,148 for a loan amount greater than or equal to 
$14,356 but less than $22,969; or 8 percent of the total loan amount 
for loans less than $14,356. The Bureau is amending comment 
43(e)(3)(ii)-1, which lists the

[[Page 60360]]

adjustments for each year, to reflect the new dollar threshold amounts 
for 2022.

III. Procedural Requirements

A. Administrative Procedure Act

    Under the Administrative Procedure Act, notice and opportunity for 
public comment are not required if the Bureau finds that notice and 
public comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest.\11\ Pursuant to this final rule, in Regulation Z, 
Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) in subpart G is amended and comments 
32(a)(1)(ii)-1.vii and -3.vii, 43(e)(3)(ii)-1.vii, and 52(b)(1)(ii)-
2.i.H in Supplement I are added to update the exemption thresholds. The 
amendments in this final rule are technical and non-discretionary, as 
they merely apply the method previously established in Regulation Z for 
determining adjustments to the thresholds. Section 1026.43(e)(2)(vi) of 
Regulation Z is also amended to add a cross-reference to the official 
commentary of Regulation Z where historical threshold dollar amounts 
for Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(A) through (F) can be located. This 
amendment is technical and for informational purposes only, as it 
merely provides a cross-reference to existing commentary that will list 
current and past threshold adjustments already required by Regulation 
Z. For these reasons, the Bureau has determined that publishing a 
notice of proposed rulemaking and providing opportunity for public 
comment are unnecessary. The amendments therefore are adopted in final 
form.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act does not require an initial or final 
regulatory flexibility analysis.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ 5 U.S.C. 603(a), 604(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995,\13\ the 
Bureau reviewed this final rule. No collections of information pursuant 
to the Paperwork Reduction Act are contained in the final rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ 44 U.S.C. 3506; 5 CFR part 1320.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Congressional Review Act

    Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), 
the Bureau will submit a report containing this rule and other required 
information to the United States Senate, the United States House of 
Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior 
to the rule taking effect. The Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs (OIRA) has designated this rule as not a ``major rule'' as 
defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

E. Signing Authority

    The Associate Director of Research, Markets, and Regulations, Janis 
K. Pappalardo, having reviewed and approved this document, is 
delegating the authority to electronically sign this document to Laura 
Galban, Bureau Federal Register Liaison, for purposes of publication in 
the Federal Register.

2. Amend Sec.  1026.43 by revising paragraph (e)(2)(vi) introductory 
text to read as follows:


Sec.  1026.43   Minimum standards for transactions secured by a 
dwelling.

* * * * *
    (e) * * *
    (2) * * *
    (vi) For which the annual percentage rate does not exceed the 
average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date 
the interest rate is set by the amounts specified in paragraphs

shall be adjusted annually on January 1 by the annual percentage change 
in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) that was 
reported on the preceding June 1. For purposes of this paragraph 
(e)(2)(vi), the creditor must determine the annual percentage rate for 
a loan for which the interest rate may or will change within the first 
five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment 
will be due by treating the maximum interest rate that may apply during 
that five-year period as the interest rate for the full term of the 
loan. See the official commentary to this paragraph (e)(2)(vi) for the 
current dollar amounts.

Section 1026.32--Requirements for High-Cost Mortgages

* * * * *
    Paragraph 32(a)(1)(ii).
    1. Annual adjustment of $1,000 amount. The $1,000 figure in 
Sec.  1026.32(a)(1)(ii)(B) is adjusted annually on January 1 by the 
annual percentage change in the CPI that was in effect on the 
preceding June 1. The Bureau will publish adjustments after the June 
figures become available each year.
    i. For 2015, $1,020, reflecting a 2 percent increase in the CPI-
U from June 2013 to June 2014, rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
    ii. For 2016, $1,017, reflecting a 0.2 percent decrease in the 
CPI-U from June 2014 to June 2015, rounded to the nearest whole 
dollar.
    iii. For 2017, $1,029, reflecting a 1.1 percent increase in the 
CPI-U from June 2015 to June 2016, rounded to the nearest whole

2014, a mortgage loan was covered by Sec.  1026.32 if the total 
points and fees payable by the consumer at or before loan 
consummation exceeded the greater of $400 or 8 percent of the total 
loan amount. The $400 figure was adjusted annually on January 1 by 
the annual percentage change in the CPI that was in effect on the

    3. Applicable threshold. For purposes of Sec.  
1026.32(a)(1)(ii), a creditor must determine the applicable points 
and fees threshold based on the face amount of the note (or, in the 
case of an open-end credit plan, the credit limit for the plan when 
the account is opened). However, the creditor must apply the 
allowable points and fees percentage to the ``total loan amount,'' 
as defined in Sec.  1026.32(b)(4). For closed-end credit 
transactions, the total loan amount may be different than the face 
amount of the note. The $20,000 amount in Sec.  1026.32(a)(1)(ii)(A) 
and (B) is adjusted annually on January 1 by the annual percentage 
change in the CPI that was in effect on the preceding June 1.
    i. For 2015, $20,391, reflecting a 2 percent increase in the 
CPI-U from June 2013 to June 2014, rounded to the nearest whole 
dollar.

CPI-U from June 2015 to June 2016, rounded to the nearest whole 
dollar.
    iv. For 2018, $21,032, reflecting a 2.2 percent increase in the 
CPI-U from June 2016 to June 2017, rounded to the nearest whole 
dollar.
    v. For 2019, $21,549, reflecting a 2.5 percent increase in the 
CPI-U from June 2017 to June 2018, rounded to the nearest whole 
dollar.
    vi. For 2020, $21,980, reflecting a 2 percent increase in the 
CPI-U from June 2018 to June 2019, rounded to the nearest whole 
dollar.
    vii. For 2021, $22,052 reflecting a 0.3 percent increase in the 
CPI-U from June 2019 to June 2020, rounded to the nearest whole 
dollar.
    viii. For 2022, $22,969 reflecting a 4.2 percent increase in the 
CPI-U from June 2020 to June 2021, rounded to the nearest whole 
dollar.

    Section 1026.43--Minimum Standards for Transactions Secured by a 
Dwelling
* * * * *
    Paragraph 43(e)(2)(vi).
    1. Determining the average prime offer rate for a comparable 
transaction as of the date the interest rate is set. For guidance on 
determining the average prime offer rate for a comparable 
transaction as of the date the interest rate is set, see comments 
43(b)(4)-1 through -3.
    2. Determination of applicable threshold. A creditor must 
determine the applicable threshold by determining which category the 
loan falls into based on the face amount of the note (the ``loan 
amount'' as defined in Sec.  1026.43(b)(5)). For example, for a 
first-lien covered transaction with a loan amount of $75,000, the 
loan would fall into the tier for loans greater than or equal to 
$66,156 (indexed for inflation) but less than $110,260 (indexed for 
inflation), for which the applicable threshold is 3.5 or more 
percentage points.
    3. Annual adjustment for inflation. The dollar amounts in Sec.  
1026.43(e)(2)(vi) will be adjusted annually on January 1 by the 
annual percentage change in the CPI-U that was in effect on the 
preceding June 1. The Bureau will publish adjustments after the June 
figures become available each year.
    i. For 2022, reflecting a 4.2 percent increase in the CPI-U that 
was reported on the preceding June 1, to satisfy Sec.  
1026.43(e)(2)(vi), the annual percentage rate may not exceed the 
average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date 
the interest rate is set by the following amounts:
    A. For a first-lien covered transaction with a loan amount 
greater than or equal to $114,847, 2.25 or more percentage points;
    B. For a first-lien covered transaction with a loan amount 
greater than or equal to $68,908 but less than $114,847, 3.5 or more 
percentage points;
    C. For a first-lien covered transaction with a loan amount less 
than $68,908, 6.5 or more percentage points;
    D. For a first-lien covered transaction secured by a 
manufactured home with a loan amount less than $114,847, 6.5 or more 
percentage points;
    E. For a subordinate-lien covered transaction with a loan amount 
greater than or equal to $68,908, 3.5 or more percentage points;
    F. For a subordinate-lien covered transaction with a loan amount 
less than $68,908, 6.5 or more percentage points.
    4. Determining the annual percentage rate for certain loans for 
which the interest rate may or will change.
    i. In general. The commentary to Sec.  1026.17(c)(1) and other 
provisions in subpart C of this part address how to determine the 
annual percentage rate disclosures for closed-end credit 
transactions. Provisions in Sec.  1026.32(a)(3) address how to 
determine the annual percentage rate to determine coverage under 
Sec.  1026.32(a)(1)(i). Section 1026.43(e)(2)(vi) requires, for the 
purposes of Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(vi), a different determination of 
the annual percentage rate for a qualified mortgage under Sec.  
1026.43(e)(2) for which the interest rate may or will change within 
the first five years after the date on which the first regular 
periodic payment will be due. An identical special rule for 
determining the annual percentage rate for such a loan also applies 
for purposes of Sec.  1026.43(b)(4).
    ii. Loans for which the interest rate may or will change. 
Section 1026.43(e)(2)(vi) includes a special rule for determining 
the annual percentage rate for a loan for which the interest rate 
may or will change within the first five years after the date on 
which the first regular periodic payment will be due. This rule 
applies to adjustable-rate mortgages that have a fixed-rate period 
of five years or less and to step-rate mortgages for which the 
interest rate changes within that five-year period.
    iii. Maximum interest rate during the first five years. For a 
loan for which the interest rate may or will change within the first 
five

[[Page 60362]]

years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment 
will be due, a creditor must treat the maximum interest rate that 
could apply at any time during that five-year period as the interest 
rate for the full term of the loan to determine the annual 
percentage rate for purposes of Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(vi), regardless 
of whether the maximum interest rate is reached at the first or 
subsequent adjustment during the five-year period. For additional 
instruction on how to determine the maximum interest rate during the 
first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic 
payment will be due, see comments 43(e)(2)(iv)-3 and -4.
    iv. Treatment of the maximum interest rate in determining the 
annual percentage rate. For a loan for which the interest rate may 
or will change within the first five years after the date on which 
the first regular periodic payment will be due, the creditor must 
determine the annual percentage rate for purposes of Sec.  
1026.43(e)(2)(vi) by treating the maximum interest rate that may 
apply within the first five years as the interest rate for the full 
term of the loan. For example, assume an adjustable-rate mortgage 
with a loan term of 30 years and an initial discounted rate of 5.0 
percent that is fixed for the first three years. Assume that the 
maximum interest rate during the first five years after the date on 
which the first regular periodic payment will be due is 7.0 percent. 
Pursuant to Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(vi), the creditor must determine the 
annual percentage rate based on an interest rate of 7.0 percent 
applied for the full 30-year loan term.
    5. Meaning of a manufactured home. For purposes of Sec.  
1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(D), manufactured home means any residential 
structure as defined under regulations of the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) establishing manufactured home 
construction and safety standards (24 CFR 3280.2). Modular or other 
factory-built homes that do not meet the HUD code standards are not 
manufactured homes for purposes of Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(D).
    6. Scope of threshold for transactions secured by a manufactured 
home. The threshold in Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(D) applies to first-
lien covered transactions less than $110,260 (indexed for inflation) 
that are secured by a manufactured home and land, or by a 
manufactured home only.
* * * * *
    Paragraph 43(e)(3)(ii).
    1. Annual adjustment for inflation. The dollar amounts, 
including the loan amounts, in Sec.  1026.43(e)(3)(i) will be 
adjusted annually on January 1 by the annual percentage change in 
the CPI-U that was in effect on the preceding June 1. The Bureau 
will publish adjustments after the June figures become available 
each year.
    i. For 2015, reflecting a 2 percent increase in the CPI-U that 
was reported on the preceding June 1, a covered transaction is not a 
qualified mortgage unless the transactions total points and fees do 
not exceed;
    A. For a loan amount greater than or equal to $101,953: 3 
percent of the total loan amount;
    B. For a loan amount greater than or equal to $61,172 but less 
than $101,953: $3,059;
    C. For a loan amount greater than or equal to $20,391 but less

    D. For a loan amount greater than or equal to $12,719 but less 
than $20,350; $1,017;
    E. For a loan amount less than $12,719: 8 percent of the total 
loan amount.

than $20,579: $1,029;
    E. For a loan amount less than $12,862: 8 percent of the total 
loan amount.
    iv. For 2018, reflecting a 2.2 percent increase in the CPI-U 
that was reported on the preceding June 1, a covered transaction is 
not a qualified mortgage unless the transaction's total points and 
fees do not exceed:
    A. For a loan amount greater than or equal to $105,158: 3 
percent of the total loan amount;
    B. For a loan amount greater than or equal to $63,095 but less 
than $105,158: $3,155;
    C. For a loan amount greater than or equal to $21,032 but less 
than $63,095: 5 percent of the total loan amount;
    D. For a loan amount greater than or equal to $13,145 but less 
than $21,032: $1,052;
    E. For a loan amount less than $13,145: 8 percent of the total 
loan amount.
    v. For 2019, reflecting a 2.5 percent increase in the CPI-U that

Section 1026.52--Limitations on Fees

* * * * *

52(b)(1)(ii) Safe Harbors

    1. Multiple violations of same type. i. Same billing cycle or 
next six billing cycles. A card issuer cannot impose a fee for a 
violation pursuant to Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) unless a fee has 
previously been imposed for the same type of violation pursuant to 
Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). Once a fee has been imposed for a 
violation pursuant to Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer 
may impose a fee pursuant to Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) for any 
subsequent violation of the same type until that type of violation 
has not occurred for a period of six consecutive complete billing 
cycles. A fee has been imposed for purposes of Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii) even if the

[[Page 60363]]

card issuer waives or rebates all or part of the fee.
    A. Late payments. For purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii), a 
late payment occurs during the billing cycle in which the payment 
may first be treated as late consistent with the requirements of 
this part and the terms or other requirements of the account.
    B. Returned payments. For purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii), a 
returned payment occurs during the billing cycle in which the 
payment is returned to the card issuer.
    C. Transactions that exceed the credit limit. For purposes of 
Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii), a transaction that exceeds the credit limit 
for an account occurs during the billing cycle in which the 
transaction occurs or is authorized by the card issuer.
    D. Declined access checks. For purposes of Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii), a check that accesses a credit card account is 
declined during the billing cycle in which the card issuer declines 
payment on the check.
    ii. Relationship to Sec. Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(ii) and 
1026.56(j)(1). If multiple violations are based on the same event or 
transaction such that Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card 
issuer from imposing more than one fee, the event or transaction 
constitutes a single violation for purposes of Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii). Furthermore, consistent with Sec.  
1026.56(j)(1)(i), no more than one violation for exceeding an 
account's credit limit can occur during a single billing cycle for 
purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii). However, Sec.  
1026.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit a card issuer from imposing fees 
for exceeding the credit limit in consecutive billing cycles based 
on the same over-the-limit transaction to the extent permitted by 
Sec.  1026.56(j)(1). In these circumstances, the second and third 
over-the-limit fees permitted by Sec.  1026.56(j)(1) may be imposed 
pursuant to Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B). See comment 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.
    iii. Examples. The following examples illustrate the application 
of Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect to 
credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer 
credit plan that are not charge card accounts. For purposes of these 
examples, assume that the billing cycles for the account begin on 
the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and 
that the payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth day of 
the month.
    A. Violations of same type (late payments). A required minimum 
periodic payment of $50 is due on March 25. On March 26, a late 
payment has occurred because no payment has been received. 
Accordingly, consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card 
issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee on March 26. In order for the 
card issuer to impose a $35 late payment fee pursuant to Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), a second late payment must occur during the 
April, May, June, July, August, or September billing cycles.
    1. The card issuer does not receive any payment during the March 
billing cycle. A required minimum periodic payment of $100 is due on 
April 25. On April 20, the card issuer receives a $50 payment. No 
further payment is received during the April billing cycle. 
Accordingly, consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), the card 
issuer may impose a $35 late payment fee on April 26. Furthermore, 
the card issuer may impose a $35 late payment fee for any late 
payment that occurs during the May, June, July, August, September, 
or October billing cycles.
    2. Same facts as in paragraph A above. On March 30, the card 
issuer receives a $50 payment and the required minimum periodic 
payments for the April, May, June, July, August, and September 
billing cycles are received on or before the payment due date. A 
required minimum periodic payment of $60 is due on October 25. On 
October 26, a late payment has occurred because the required minimum 
periodic payment due on October 25 has not been received. However, 
because this late payment did not occur during the six billing 
cycles following the March billing cycle, Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii) 
only permits the card issuer to impose a late payment fee of $25.
    B. Violations of different types (late payment and over the 
credit limit). The credit limit for an account is $1,000. Consistent 
with Sec.  1026.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the 
payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit. A required 
minimum periodic payment of $30 is due on August 25. On August 26, a 
late payment has occurred because no payment has been received. 
Accordingly, consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card 
issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee on August 26. On August 30, 
the card issuer receives a $30 payment. On September 10, a 
transaction causes the account balance to increase to $1,150, which 
exceeds the account's $1,000 credit limit. On September 11, a second 
transaction increases the account balance to $1,350. On September 
23, the card issuer receives the $50 required minimum periodic 
payment due on September 25, which reduces the account balance to 
$1,300. On September 30, the card issuer imposes a $25 over-the-
limit fee, consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). On October 
26, a late payment has occurred because the $60 required minimum 
periodic payment due on October 25 has not been received. 
Accordingly, consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), the card 
issuer imposes a $35 late payment fee on October 26.
    C. Violations of different types (late payment and returned 
payment). A required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on July 
25. On July 26, a late payment has occurred because no payment has 
been received. Accordingly, consistent with Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee 
on July 26. On July 30, the card issuer receives a $50 payment. A 
required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on August 25. On 
August 24, a $50 payment is received. On August 27, the $50 payment 
is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds. In these 
circumstances, Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(ii) permits the card issuer to 
impose either a late payment fee or a returned payment fee but not 
both because the late payment and the returned payment result from 
the same event or transaction. Accordingly, for purposes of Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii), the event or transaction constitutes a single 
violation. However, if the card issuer imposes a late payment fee, 
Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) permits the issuer to impose a fee of $35 
because the late payment occurred during the six billing cycles 
following the July billing cycle. In contrast, if the card issuer 
imposes a returned payment fee, the amount of the fee may be no more 
than $25 pursuant to Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A).
    2. Adjustments based on Consumer Price Index. For purposes of 
Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B), the Bureau shall 
calculate each year price level adjusted amounts using the Consumer 
Price Index in effect on June 1 of that year. When the cumulative 
change in the adjusted minimum value derived from applying the 
annual Consumer Price level to the current amounts in Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) has risen by a whole dollar, 
those amounts will be increased by $1.00. Similarly, when the 
cumulative change in the adjusted minimum value derived from 
applying the annual Consumer Price level to the current amounts in 
Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) has decreased by a 
whole dollar, those amounts will be decreased by $1.00. The Bureau 
will publish adjustments to the amounts in Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B).
    i. Historical thresholds.
    A. Card issuers were permitted to impose a fee for violating the 
terms of an agreement if the fee did not exceed $25 under Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and $35 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), 
through December 31, 2013.
    B. Card issuers were permitted to impose a fee for violating the 
terms of an agreement if the fee did not exceed $26 under Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and $37 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), 
through December 31, 2014.
    C. Card issuers were permitted to impose a fee for violating the 
terms of an agreement if the fee did not exceed $27 under Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and $38 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), 
through December 31, 2015.
    D. Card issuers were permitted to impose a fee for violating the 
terms of an agreement if the fee did not exceed $27 under Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), through December 31, 2016. Card issuers were 
permitted to impose a fee for violating the terms of an agreement if 
the fee did not exceed $37 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), through 
June 26, 2016, and $38 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) from June 
27, 2016 through December 31, 2016.
    E. Card issuers were permitted to impose a fee for violating the 
terms of an agreement if the fee did not exceed $27 under Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and $38 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), 
through December 31, 2017.
    F. Card issuers were permitted to impose a fee for violating the 
terms of an agreement if the fee did not exceed $27 under Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and $38 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), 
through December 31, 2018.
    G. Card issuers were permitted to impose a fee for violating the 
terms of an agreement if the fee did not exceed $28 under Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and $39 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), 
through December 31, 2019.
    H. Card issuers were permitted to impose a fee for violating the 
terms of an agreement

if the fee did not exceed $29 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and 
$40 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), through December 31, 2020.
    I. Card issuers were permitted to impose a fee for violating the 
terms of an agreement if the fee did not exceed $29 under Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and $40 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), 
through December 31, 2021.
    3. Delinquent balance for charge card accounts. Section 
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C) provides that, when a charge card issuer that 
requires payment of outstanding balances in full at the end of each 
billing cycle has not received the required payment for two or more 
consecutive billing cycles, the card issuer may impose a late 
payment fee that does not exceed three percent of the delinquent 
balance. For purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the delinquent 
balance is any previously billed amount that remains unpaid at the 
time the late payment fee is imposed pursuant to Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C). Consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(ii), a 
charge card issuer that imposes a fee pursuant to Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C) with respect to a late payment may not impose a 
fee pursuant to Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect to the same 
late payment. The following examples illustrate the application of 
Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C):
    i. Assume that a charge card issuer requires payment of 
outstanding balances in full at the end of each billing cycle and 
that the billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of 
the month and end on the last day of the month. At the end of the 
June billing cycle, the account has a balance of $1,000. On July 5, 
the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing the $1,000 
balance consistent with Sec.  1026.7. During the July billing cycle, 
the account is used for $300 in transactions, increasing the balance 
to $1,300. At the end of the July billing cycle, no payment has been 
received and the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee 
consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). On August 5, the card 
issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing the $1,325 balance 
consistent with Sec.  1026.7. During the August billing cycle, the 
account is used for $200 in transactions, increasing the balance to 
$1,525. At the end of the August billing cycle, no payment has been 
received. Consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the card 
issuer may impose a late payment fee of $40, which is 3% of the 
$1,325 balance that was due at the end of the August billing cycle. 
Section 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C) does not permit the card issuer to 
include the $200 in transactions that occurred during the August 
billing cycle.
    ii. Same facts as above except that, on August 25, a $100 
payment is received. Consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the 
card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $37, which is 3% of the 
unpaid portion of the $1,325 balance that was due at the end of the 
August billing cycle ($1,225).
    iii. Same facts as in paragraph A above except that, on August 
25, a $200 payment is received. Consistent with Sec.  
1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee 
of $34, which is 3% of the unpaid portion of the $1,325 balance that 
was due at the end of the August billing cycle ($1,125). In the 
alternative, the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $35 
consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B). However, Sec.  
1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees.
