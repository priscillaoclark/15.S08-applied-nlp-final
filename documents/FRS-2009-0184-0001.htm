Guidelines for Furnishers of Information to Consumer Reporting 
Agencies

AGENCIES: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury (OCC); 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board); Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); Office of Thrift Supervision, 
Treasury (OTS); National Credit Union Administration (NCUA); and 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The OCC, Board, FDIC, OTS, NCUA, and FTC (Agencies) request 
comment to gather information that would assist the Agencies in 
considering the development of a possible proposed addition to the 
furnisher accuracy and integrity guidelines that were issued in today's 
Federal Register. Those guidelines, along with the accompanying 
regulations, implement the accuracy and integrity provisions in section 
312 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act) 
that amended section 623 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This 
advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) seeks to obtain 
information that would assist the Agencies in determining whether it 
would be appropriate to propose an addition to one of the guidelines 
that would delineate the circumstances under which a furnisher would be 
expected to provide an account opening date to a consumer reporting 
agency to promote the integrity of the information. In addition, the 
Agencies request comment more broadly on whether furnishers should be 
expected to provide any other types of information to a consumer 
reporting agency in order to promote integrity.

DATES: Comments must be submitted by August 31, 2009.

ADDRESSES: Because paper mail in the Washington, DC area and at the 
Agencies is subject to delay, commenters are encouraged to submit

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which was enacted in 1970, 
sets standards for the collection, communication, and use of 
information bearing on a consumer's creditworthiness, credit standing, 
credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal 
characteristics, or mode of living.\2\ In 1996, the Consumer Credit 
Reporting Reform Act extensively amended the FCRA.\3\ The FACT Act \4\ 
further amended the FCRA for various purposes, including improved 
accuracy of consumer reports.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681x.
    \3\ Public Law 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 20, 1996).
    \4\ Public Law 108-159, 117 Stat. 1952 (Dec. 4, 2003).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 623 of the FCRA describes the responsibilities of persons 
that furnish information about consumers (furnishers) to consumer 
reporting agencies (CRAs).\5\ Section 312 of the FACT Act amended 
section 623 of the FCRA by requiring the Agencies to issue guidelines 
for use by furnishers regarding the accuracy and integrity of the 
information about consumers that they furnish to CRAs and to prescribe 
regulations requiring furnishers to establish reasonable policies and 
procedures for implementing the guidelines (referred to in this ANPR as 
the accuracy and integrity regulations and guidelines).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Section 623 is codified at 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In this issue of the Federal Register, the Agencies promulgated 
final rules and guidelines to implement section 312 of the FACT Act. 
Section --.41(e) \6\ of the final rules defines the term ``integrity'' 
to mean that information that a furnisher provides to a CRA about an 
account or other relationship with the consumer:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Section 660.2(e) in the FTC's rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Is substantiated by the furnisher's records at the time it 
is furnished;
    <bullet> Is furnished in a form and manner that is designed to 
minimize the likelihood that the information may be incorrectly 
reflected in a consumer report; and
    <bullet> Includes the information in a furnisher's possession about 
the account or other relationship that the relevant Agency has:
    [cir] Determined that the absence of which would likely be 
materially misleading in evaluating a consumer's creditworthiness, 
credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, 
personal characteristics, or mode of living; and
    [cir] Listed in section I.(b)(2)(iii) of the guidelines.
    Section I.(b)(2)(iii) of the guidelines lists a ``credit limit, if 
applicable and in the furnisher's possession.'' Thus, under the final 
rule that cross-references this provision of the guidelines, 
information relating to a consumer that is furnished to a CRA will not 
be deemed to have ``integrity'' if it does not include a credit limit, 
if the account or relationship with the consumer has a credit limit, 
and the credit limit is in the possession of the furnisher.
    The Agencies now seek information to determine if they should 
include the account opening date as another item to be included in 
section I.(b)(2)(iii) of the guidelines. The Agencies also request 
comment on any other items that should be included in section 
I.(b)(2)(iii) of the guidelines in order to promote the integrity of 
information furnished to CRAs. Specifically, the Agencies request 
comment on whether there are other items of information the absence of 
which would likely be materially misleading in evaluating a consumer's 
creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general 
reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living, and which the 
Agencies should

[[Page 31532]]

list in section I.(b)(2)(iii) of the guidelines.

II. Account Opening Date

    In general, credit scoring models use the following factors to 
generate a credit score: payment history, credit utilization (amount 
owed compared to the credit limit), length of credit history (time 
since accounts opened and time since account activity), number and 
types of credit accounts, new credit established, types of credit used, 
and bankruptcy filings.\7\ The Agencies understand that an account 
opening date may be used to determine the length of a consumer's credit 
history. A long-established credit history tends to affect positively a 
consumer's credit score, and may similarly affect other assessments of 
a consumer's creditworthiness.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Robert B. Avery, Raphael W. Bostic, Paul S. Calem & 
Glenn B. Canner, An Overview of Consumer Data and Credit Reporting, 
Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 89, at 47-73 (Feb. 2003); Robert B. 
Avery, Paul S. Calem, Glenn B. Canner & Shannon C. Mok, Credit 
Report Accuracy and Access to Credit, Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 
90, at 297-322 (Summer 2004).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Agencies understand that some furnishers, including furnishers 
that provide only negative information to CRAs, may not include account 
opening dates in the information they provide to CRAs. The Agencies are 
concerned that, for at least some consumers, this practice may result 
in a lower credit score for the consumer than otherwise would be the 
case (or otherwise result in a more negative assessment of the 
consumer's creditworthiness). Therefore, the omission of the account 
opening date may result in higher costs and reduced access to credit 
and other products and services and present an incorrect impression of 
credit and other risks to lenders and other users of consumer reports.
    The Agencies also recognize, however, that it is possible that the 
account opening date may not be a significant factor in determining a 
credit score in certain credit scoring models or in other assessments 
of a consumer's creditworthiness; that some credit scoring models and 
other assessment systems might be adjusted to compensate for the 
absence of an account opening date; and that other data might 
effectively be substituted for an account opening date.

III. Request for Comments

    The Agencies believe that, in advance of proposing any additions or 
changes to the accuracy and integrity guidelines, it is appropriate to 
invite comment from all interested parties on the following issues:
    <bullet> To what extent, and under what circumstances, do 
furnishers provide account opening dates to CRAs? What factors 
determine whether that information will be provided?
    <bullet> Would the absence of an account opening date or any other 
specific item in the information a furnisher provides to a CRA likely 
be materially misleading in evaluating a consumer's creditworthiness, 
credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, 
personal characteristics, or mode of living? If so, how, and under what 
circumstances?
    <bullet> Does the omission of an account opening date or other 
items of information otherwise compromise the integrity of information 
provided by furnishers to CRAs? If so, how, and under what 
circumstances?
    <bullet> Should certain types of credit or other products or 
services be exempt from any proposed guideline for furnishing an 
account opening date or other items of information? For example, should 
any such new rules or guidelines be applicable only to mortgage or 
credit card products? Alternatively, should such rules or guidelines 
apply only to credit that is ``consumer credit'' as defined by 
Regulation Z (12 CFR 226)? Should any other types of credit products or 
services should be exempt, and, if so, why?
    <bullet> Should accounts for which both positive and negative 
activity has been furnished on a regular basis for a certain period of 
time be exempt from any proposed rule or guideline for furnishing an 
account opening date or other items of information? If so, what is the 
appropriate period of time, and why?
    <bullet> How should ``account opening date'' or other terms used to 
identify other items of information be defined, if at all? Are there 
types of credit or other products or services that, because of their 
nature, would not have an account opening date or other identified 
items of information? If so, please identify such credit products or 
services and explain why they would not have an account opening date or 
other identified items of information.
    <bullet> What specific costs and benefits would be incurred and 
realized by consumers if furnishers were expected to furnish an account 
opening date or other items of information to CRAs?
    <bullet> What specific costs and benefits would be incurred and 
realized by furnishers and users of consumer reports if furnishers were 
expected to furnish an account opening date or other items of 
information to CRAs?
    <bullet> What would be the effect on the credit reporting system if 
furnishers were expected to furnish an account opening date or other 
items of information to CRAs?
    In addition, the Agencies specifically invite comment as follows:
    The Agencies invite comment from individuals and consumer 
organizations on the effect on consumers and the credit reporting 
system if furnishers were required to provide CRAs with an account 
opening date or other items of information.
    In addition, the Agencies recognize that small institutions operate 
with more limited resources than larger institutions. Thus, the 
Agencies specifically request comment on the impact on small 
institutions of a possible future proposal that would require 
furnishers to furnish more information to CRAs, such as an account 
opening date, and whether the goals of a possible future proposal could 
be achieved for small institutions through an alternative approach.
    Finally, the Agencies invite comment on how a future proposal could 
affect the furnishing of information to specialized types of CRAs, such 
as CRAs that collect information for the purpose of making decisions 
regarding insurance, employment or tenant screening, or check 
verification, and to nontraditional CRAs that may only provide 
information to a limited class of businesses (e.g., medical information 
providers and tenant screening services).

IV. Regulatory Analysis

Executive Order 12866

    Executive Order 12866 requires the preparation of an analysis for 
agency actions that are ``significant regulatory actions.'' 
``Significant regulatory actions'' are actions that may result in 
regulations that are likely to:
    <bullet> Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the 
economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public 
health or safety, or State, local, or Tribal governments or 
communities;
    <bullet> Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with 
an action taken or planned by another agency;
    <bullet> Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, 
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or
    <bullet> Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the

    \8\ Executive Order 12866 (Sept. 30, 1993), 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 
1993). A ``regulatory action'' is ``any substantive action by an 
agency (normally published in the Federal Register) that promulgates 
or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final rule or 
regulation, including notices of inquiry, advance notices of 
proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking.'' Executive 
Order 12866, section 3(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This ANPR neither establishes nor proposes any regulatory 
requirements. Because this ANPR does not contain a specific proposal, 
information is not available with which to prepare a regulatory 
analysis. The OCC and OTS will each prepare a regulatory analysis if 
they proceed with a proposed rule that constitutes a significant 
regulatory action.
    Accordingly, the OCC and OTS solicit comment, information, and data 
on the potential effects on the economy of any changes to the 
guidelines that commenters may recommend. The OCC and OTS encourage 
commenters to provide information about estimates of costs, benefits, 
other effects, or any other information. In addition, the OCC and OTS 
ask commenters to identify or estimate start-up or non-recurring costs 
separately from costs or effects they believe would be ongoing. 
Quantitative information would be the most useful. The OCC and OTS will 
carefully consider the costs and benefits associated with any proposed 
changes to the guidelines.
