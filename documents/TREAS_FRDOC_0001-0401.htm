Extension and Amendment of Import Restrictions Imposed on 
Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Greece

AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland 
Security; Department of Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This final rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) Regulations to reflect an extension and amendment of import 
restrictions on certain archaeological and ecclesiastical ethnological 
material of the Hellenic Republic (Greece). The restrictions, which 
were originally imposed by CBP Dec. 11-25 and last extended in CBP Dec. 
16-21, are due to expire on November 21, 2021. The Acting Assistant 
Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States 
Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for 
extending the import restrictions that previously existed, and the 
Government of the United States and the Government of Greece entered 
into a new agreement to reflect the extension of these import 
restrictions. The new agreement, which enters into force on November 
21, 2021, supersedes the existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
that became effective on November 21, 2016, and enabled the 
promulgation of the existing import restrictions. Accordingly, the 
import restrictions will remain in effect for an additional five years, 
and the CBP regulations are being amended to reflect this extension 
until November 21, 2026. To fulfill the terms of the new MOU, the 
Designated List of cultural property, which was described in CBP Dec. 
11-25, is amended in this document to correct certain typographical 
errors, to add certain coins from the Byzantine and Medieval periods, 
to clarify pottery styles, and to include post-Byzantine ethnological 
material dating up to A.D. 1830.

DATES: Effective November 21, 2021.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    Pursuant to the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, 
Public Law 97-446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. (hereinafter, ``the Cultural 
Property Implementation Act''), which implements the 1970 United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit 
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property 
(hereinafter, ``the Convention'' (823 U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)), the United 
States entered into a bilateral agreement with Greece on November 21, 
2011. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) enabled the promulgation of 
import restrictions on archaeological material representing Greece's 
cultural heritage from the Upper Paleolithic (beginning approximately 
20,000 B.C.) through the 15th century A.D., and ecclesiastical 
ethnological material representing Greece's Byzantine cultural heritage 
(approximately the 4th century through the 15th century A.D.).
    On December 1, 2011, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
published CBP Dec. 11-25, in the Federal Register (76 FR 74691), which 
amended 19 CFR 12.104g(a) to indicate the imposition of these 
restrictions and included a list designating the types of 
archaeological and ecclesiastical ethnological material covered by the 
restrictions. The restrictions were subsequently extended in 2016. CBP 
published a final rule (CBP Dec. 16-21) in the Federal Register (81 FR 
84458), following the exchange of diplomatic notes, extending the 
import restrictions for a period of five years until November 21, 2021.
    Import restrictions listed at 19 CFR 12.104g(a) are effective for 
no more than five years beginning on the date on which the agreement 
enters into force with respect to the United States. This period may be 
extended for additional periods of not more than five years if it is 
determined that the factors which justified the initial agreement still 
pertain and no cause for suspension of the agreement exists. Since the 
initial notice was published on December 1, 2011, the import 
restrictions have been extended once. Following the exchange of 
diplomatic notes, CBP published a final rule (CBP Dec. 16-21) in the 
Federal Register (81 FR 84458), to extend the import restrictions for a 
period of five years to November 21, 2021.
    On August 20, 2020, the United States Department of State proposed 
in the Federal Register (85 FR 51544), to extend the MOU between the 
United States and Greece concerning the import restrictions on certain 
categories of archeological and ecclesiastical ethnological material of 
Greece. On March 21, 2021, the Acting Assistant Secretary for 
Educational and Cultural Affairs, Department of State, after 
consultation with and recommendations by the Cultural Property Advisory 
Committee, determined that the cultural heritage of Greece continues to 
be in jeopardy from pillage of certain archaeological and 
ecclesiastical ethnological material, and that the import restrictions 
should be extended for an additional five years.
    Subsequently, on September 22, 2021, the Governments of the United 
States and Greece entered into a new agreement, titled ``Memorandum of 
Understanding between the Government of the United States of America 
and the Government of the Hellenic Republic Concerning the Imposition 
of Import Restrictions on Categories of Certain Archaeological and 
Ethnological Materials of the Hellenic Republic,'' which is effective 
on November 21, 2021. The new MOU supersedes the existing MOU that 
first entered into force on November 21, 2011. Pursuant to the new MOU, 
the import restrictions will remain in effect for an additional five 
years.
    Accordingly, CBP is amending 19 CFR 12.104g(a) to reflect the 
extension of the import restrictions. The restrictions are to continue 
in effect until November 21, 2026. Importation of such material of 
Greece, as described in the Designated List below, shall be restricted 
through that date unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 
19 CFR 12.104c are met.
    The Designated List and additional information may also be found at 
the following website address: <a href="https://eca.state.gov/cultural-heritage-center/cultural-property-advisory-committee/current-import-restrictions">https://eca.state.gov/cultural-heritage-center/cultural-property-advisory-committee/current-import-restrictions</a> 
by selecting the material for ``Greece.''

Designated List of Archaeological and Ecclesiastical Ethnological 
Material of Greece

    The Designated List contained in CBP Dec. 11-25, which describes 
the types of articles to which the import restrictions apply, is 
amended to reflect the addition of certain archaeological and 
ecclesiastical ethnological material to the Designated List. To fulfill 
the terms

[[Page 66165]]

of the new MOU, the Designated List of cultural property is amended in 
this document to add certain coins from the Byzantine and Medieval 
periods, to clarify pottery styles, and to include post-Byzantine 
ethnological material dating up to A.D. 1830, as well as clarify 
certain provisions of the Designated List contained in CBP Dec. 11-25 
by making minor revisions to the language, organization, and numbering 
of the Designated List. For the reader's convenience, CBP is 
reproducing the Designated List contained in CBP Dec. 11-25 in its 
entirety, with the changes, below.
    The Designated List includes archaeological material from Greece 
ranging in date from approximately the 3rd millennium B.C. to 15th 
century A.D., and ecclesiastical ethnological material from Greece from 
the Early Christian, Byzantine, and post-Byzantine periods, including 
objects made from A.D. 324 through 1830.

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public 
procedure; see 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). For the same reason, a delayed 
effective date is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply.

Executive Order 12866

    CBP has determined that this document is not a regulation or rule 
subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12866 because it pertains 
to a foreign affairs function of the United States, as described above, 
and therefore is specifically exempted by section 3(d)(2) of Executive 
Order 12866.

Signing Authority

    This regulation is being issued in accordance with 19 CFR 0.1(a)(1) 
pertaining to the Secretary of the Treasury's authority (or that of 
his/her delegate) to approve regulations related to customs revenue 
functions.
    Troy A. Miller, Acting Commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection, having reviewed and approved this document, is delegating

CBP, for purposes of publication in the Federal Register.
