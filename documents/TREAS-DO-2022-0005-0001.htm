SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) reauthorized and 
amended the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (SBJA) to provide $10 
billion to fund the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) as a 
response to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\1\ SSBCI is 
a federal program administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury 
(Treasury) that was created to strengthen the programs of eligible 
jurisdictions that support private financing for small businesses. 
Eligible jurisdictions include states, territories, Tribal governments, 
and eligible municipalities. SSBCI is expected to, in conjunction with 
new small business financing, create billions of dollars in lending to, 
and investments in, small businesses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ ARPA, Public Law 117-2, sec. 3301, codified at 12 U.S.C. 
5701 et seq. SSBCI was originally established in Title III of the 
Small Business Jobs Act of 2010.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Summary of the Interim Final Rule

A. Authority, Scope, and Purpose

    Treasury has authority under the SSBCI statute to issue a rule on 
collecting demographics-related data of those who own or control small 
businesses that participate in SSBCI for purposes of implementation, 
compliance and reporting, and understanding program outcomes.\2\ First, 
issuing this interim final rule is important for the implementation of 
and compliance with the program requirements regarding allocations 
related to business enterprises that are owned and controlled by 
socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (SEDI-owned and 
controlled businesses). ARPA provides $1.5 billion of capital funding 
to be allocated based on the needs of SEDI-owned and controlled 
businesses (SEDI allocation),\3\ $1.0 billion of capital funding for an 
incentive program for jurisdictions that demonstrate robust support for 
SEDI-owned and controlled businesses in the deployment of previously 
allocated SSBCI capital funding (SEDI incentive allocation),\4\ and 
$500 million for technical assistance to, in part, SEDI-owned and 
controlled businesses.\5\ ARPA also states that the $1.5 billion SEDI 
allocation must be expended for SEDI-owned and controlled 
businesses.\6\ The $1.5 billion SEDI allocation and $1.0 billion SEDI 
incentive allocation are intended to address the widespread challenges 
that these businesses have faced in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\7\ 
The technical assistance funding is to help, in part, SEDI-owned and 
controlled businesses that are applying to receive a loan, investment, 
or other credit or equity support under the SSBCI. The information 
reported under this interim final rule will help Treasury determine the 
extent to which SSBCI funds have been provided to SEDI-owned and 
controlled businesses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See 12 U.S.C. 5706, 5709.
    \3\ 12 U.S.C. 5702(d)(2).
    \4\ 12 U.S.C. 5702(e).
    \5\ 12 U.S.C. 5708(e).
    \6\ 12 U.S.C. 5702(d)(1).
    \7\ See, e.g., Cong. Rec. H1283 (Statement of Rep. Waters) (Mar. 
10, 2021) (citing ``the widespread challenges small businesses, 
especially minority-owned businesses, have faced during the COVID-19 
pandemic''); Cong. Rec. H1280 (Statement of Speaker Pelosi) (``The 
most vulnerable among us have been the most disproportionately 
affected . . . women and minority-owned businesses forced to shudder 
[sic], communities of color facing rising disparities'' and 
explaining ``This legislation will, among other steps, address 8 in 
10 minority owned businesses on the brink of closure . . . .'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Second, this interim final rule is being issued to ensure 
compliance with legal requirements related to nondiscrimination and 
nondiscriminatory uses of federal funds, where such laws are applicable 
to a participating jurisdiction and any contracted entity operating 
SSBCI programs on the jurisdiction's behalf because all SSBCI funds are 
considered federal financial assistance for purposes of such 
requirements. These legal requirements include, but are not limited to, 
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Treasury's regulations at 
31 CFR part 22, which require recipients of SSBCI funding to maintain 
and submit racial and ethnic data of beneficiaries that receive Federal 
financial assistance.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 31 CFR 22.6(b),
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Third, issuing this interim final rule is important for SSBCI 
implementation and compliance because some participating jurisdictions 
will partner with lenders or other financial entities that are subject 
to laws that prohibit these entities from inquiring about the race, 
color, religion, national origin, or sex of an applicant or any other 
person in connection with a credit transaction, unless such information 
is required by a regulation, order, or agreement issued by, or entered 
into with, an enforcement agency or a court to monitor or enforce 
compliance with federal or state statutes or regulations. For example, 
under 12 CFR part 1002 (Regulation B) implementing the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act, creditors are generally prohibited from inquiring 
about the race, color, religion, national origin, or sex of an 
applicant or any other person in connection with a credit transaction, 
unless an exception applies.\9\ One exception is for certain required 
information collection ``to monitor or enforce compliance with the 
[Equal Credit Opportunity] Act, [Regulation B], or other Federal or 
state statutes or regulations.'' \10\ This interim final rule will 
facilitate the collection of information that might not otherwise be 
collected by creditors who will be SSBCI lenders. Treasury expects 
that, in accordance with this interim final rule, participating 
jurisdictions will contract with lenders and other financial entities 
to implement SSBCI programs and collect this information. Lenders and 
other financial entities participating in SSBCI must request the 
demographic information described in this interim final rule, and 
collect and report such information certified by authorized 
representatives of participating small businesses. Although such 
lenders and other financial entities must collect and report such 
information, participating small businesses have the option to choose 
``prefer not to respond'' or to not respond by leaving the request 
blank. This interim final rule does not require verification of 
responses provided by participating small businesses. Treasury believes 
that requiring verification of small business-provided responses would 
greatly increase the operational burden of the interim final rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See 12 CFR 1002.5(b).
    \10\ 12 CFR 1002.5(a)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, this interim final rule is important for understanding 
SSBCI program outcomes. Such information will allow Treasury to analyze 
and report on the populations that SSBCI funding is benefiting.

B. Definitions and Reporting Requirements

    Under this interim final rule, each jurisdiction that participates 
in SSBCI must submit an annual report to Treasury that includes the 
following data: Self-certified SEDI demographics-related business 
status; minority-owned or controlled business status; women-owned or 
controlled business status; veteran-owned or controlled business 
status; and the race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, Middle 
Eastern or North African ancestry, and veteran status with which 
principal owners identify. For each business that receives a loan, 
investment, or other credit or equity support under the SSBCI, the 
reported data must be based on the ownership and control of the 
business immediately before the consummation of such loan, investment, 
or other credit or equity support-related transaction. For each 
business that receives technical assistance under the SSBCI, the 
reported data must be based on the ownership and control of the 
business at the time it receives such technical assistance. The self-
certified SEDI demographics-related business status variable reflects 
one group of SEDI-owned and controlled businesses on which 
jurisdictions may expend their portion of the $1.5 billion SEDI 
allocation and their portion of technical assistance funding.\11\ Loan, 
investment, or other credit or equity support-related transactions 
conducted with self-certified SEDI demographics-related businesses may 
also count toward earning a participating jurisdiction's portion of the 
$1.0 billion SEDI incentive allocation. The definition of ``owned and 
controlled,'' which is used in the definition of SEDI demographics-
related business, is based on the statutory definition of ``business 
enterprise owned and controlled by

[[Page 13630]]

socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,'' which includes 
prongs for three types of organizations: Private businesses, public 
businesses, and mutual institutions.\12\ For example, 51 percent 
ownership of a private institution is a sufficient condition to fulfill 
the ownership-and-control requirement for a business to be a self-
certified SEDI demographics-related business.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ For more information on all eligible groups of businesses 
on which jurisdictions may expend their SSBCI SEDI allocation funds, 
please see the SSBCI Capital Program Policy Guidelines published on 
Treasury's website.
    \12\ See 12 U.S.C. 5701(15).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under this interim final rule, Treasury will also collect 
information on whether the business is majority-owned or controlled by 
minority individuals, females, or veterans. These data elements do not 
affect the determination of SEDI-owned and controlled business status. 
The SSBCI statute does not define ``owned or controlled'' for purposes 
of these categories. Therefore, the definition of ``owned or 
controlled'' for purposes of these terms are based both on the 
definition of ``business enterprise owned and controlled by socially 
and economically disadvantaged individuals'' in the SSBCI statute \13\ 
and also on the control prong of the definition of ``beneficial owner'' 
in the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's (FinCEN) customer due 
diligence (CDD) rule, which requires covered financial institutions to 
establish and maintain written procedures that are reasonably designed 
to identify and verify beneficial owners of legal entity customers.\14\ 
In choosing this approach, Treasury considered that the ``beneficial 
owner'' definition under FinCEN's CDD rule is already widely in use, 
and that most financial institutions are likely familiar with the 
standard, because many of them are required to comply with the CDD 
rule. Accordingly, a business can be a minority-owned or controlled 
business, women-owned or controlled business, or veteran-owned or 
controlled business (as applicable) if (1) the applicable prong under 
the definition of ``owned and controlled'' explained above is met or 
(2) one or more minority individuals, females, or veterans, 
respectively, have the power to exercise a controlling influence over 
the management, direction, or policies of the business.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See id.
    \14\ See 31 CFR 1010.230(d)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under this interim final rule, Treasury will further collect the 
race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, Middle Eastern or North 
African ancestry, and veteran status with which the principal owners of 
all businesses that participate in SSBCI transactions that occurred in 
the preceding calendar year identify. These data elements also do not 
affect the determination of SEDI-owned and controlled business status. 
Treasury defines the term ``principal owner'' based on the ownership 
prong of the definition of beneficial ownership under FinCEN's CDD 
rule. Under this interim final rule, an individual is a principal owner 
if the individual directly or indirectly, through any contract, 
arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, owns 25 percent 
or more of the equity interests of the business.
    The categories of responses related to gender under this interim 
final rule are female, male, non-binary, an option for ``prefer to 
self-describe'' with a write-in field that allows for identification in 
a different manner, ``prefer not to respond,'' and that the business 
did not answer. In considering this approach, Treasury reviewed the 
following information. The Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey 
includes questions on sex and gender identity. One of these questions 
asks, ``What sex were you assigned at birth, on your original birth 
certificate?'' with responses including male or female. Another 
question asks, ``Do you currently describe yourself as male, female, or 
transgender?'' with responses including male, female, transgender, or 
none of these.\15\ The Department of Defense P1 survey includes a 
question that asks, ``Are you . . . ?'' with responses that include 
male or female.\16\ The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Producer 
Study includes a question that asks ``How do you currently describe 
yourself?'' with responses that include male, female, transgender, and 
none of these, specify (with a space to write-in). The same study also 
includes a question that asks, ``Was your sex recorded as male or 
female at birth?'' with responses that include male or female.\17\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's proposed rule for the 
collection of small business data asks for information on the sex of 
the principal owner with the response options of female, male, I prefer 
to self-identify as (with a space to write in), and I do not wish to 
provide this information.\18\ Treasury's approach is most consistent 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's proposed rule for 
collection of small business data in that Treasury includes response 
options of female, male, an option for ``prefer to self-describe'' with 
a write-in field (which is similar to the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau proposed rule's I prefer to self-identify as (with a space to 
write in)), and an option for ``prefer not to respond.'' Treasury also 
includes ``non-binary'' as a response in order to provide some 
consistency with other Treasury coronavirus relief programs, such as 
the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, which collects data on whether 
award recipients are female, male, non-binary, declined to answer, or 
data not collected.\19\ As businesses may elect to not choose any of 
the aforementioned responses by leaving the responses blank, Treasury 
also provides jurisdictions the option to report ``the business did not 
answer.''

Emergency Rental Assistance Program, starting on page 16, available 
at <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/ERA-Reporting-Guidance-v2.pdf">https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/ERA-Reporting-Guidance-v2.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, Treasury will collect data regarding the sexual 
orientation status with which principal owners identify with response 
options of gay or lesbian; bisexual; straight, that is, not gay, 
lesbian, or bisexual; something else; an option for the business to 
choose that it prefers not to respond; or that the business did not 
answer. Treasury is collecting this information related to sexual 
orientation to better understand the demographics of the principal 
owners of businesses receiving SSBCI funds. The collection of this 
information is expected to provide valuable insights on SSBCI program 
outcomes and small business ecosystems, along with the performance of 
businesses owned by individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, or 
bisexual.
    In considering this approach, Treasury reviewed the following 
information. The Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey includes a 
question on sexual orientation that asks, ``Which of the following best 
represents how you think of yourself?'' with responses including gay or 
lesbian; straight, that is not gay or lesbian; bisexual; something 
else; or I don't know.\20\ The Department of Defense P1 Survey also 
includes a question on

[[Page 13631]]

sexual orientation that asks, ``How do you describe your sexual 
orientation? (Select all that apply.),'' with responses including 
heterosexual or straight; lesbian or gay; bisexual, pansexual, or 
queer; questioning, asexual, demisexual; other; and prefer not to 
answer.\21\ The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Producer Study 
includes a question on sexual orientation that asks, ``Which of the 
following best represents how you think of yourself?'' with responses 
including gay or lesbian; straight, that is, not gay or lesbian; 
bisexual; none of these, specify (with a space to write in); I am not 
sure yet; and I don't know what this question means.\22\ Treasury's 
approach is generally consistent with these approaches, and most 
consistent with the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey, but 
Treasury's reporting does not include a response indicating that the 
individual does not know their sexual orientation, in part because 
responses from individual small business owners are not required by 
beneficiaries to receive funding. Treasury's decision to include an 
option for ``prefer not to respond'' is consistent with the Department 
of Defense's P1 Survey's option of ``prefer not to answer.'' As 
businesses may elect to not choose any of the aforementioned responses 
by leaving the responses blank, Treasury also provides jurisdictions 
the option to report ``the business did not answer.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Treasury will collect information about race and ethnicity statuses 
with which principal owners identify, consistent with the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) Standards for the Classification of Federal 
Data on Race and Ethnicity, which govern how questions about race and 
ethnicity should be asked on all federal collections. There are two 
ethnicity categories (Hispanic or Latino; and Not Hispanic or Latino) 
and five minimum race categories (American Indian or Alaska Native; 
Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific 
Islander; and White).\23\ Further disaggregation is allowable. For 
example, many Census Bureau surveys, as well as the Department of 
Health and Human Services' (HHS) approach for collecting data for its 
population studies, offer checkboxes for selected disaggregated 
categories for Asian (i.e., Asian Indian; Chinese; Filipino; Japanese; 
Korean; Vietnamese; and Other Asian) as well as for Native Hawaiian or 
Other Pacific Islander (i.e., Native Hawaiian; Chamorro; Samoan; and 
Other Pacific Islander).\24\ The 2020 Census offered respondents the 
opportunity to, under each of the minimum categories, write in 
additional specifics. Both minimum categories and disaggregated 
categories of race and ethnicity are used in the data collection under 
the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).\25\ The HMDA data collection 
also permits individuals to answer with ``I do not wish to provide this 
information.'' \26\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Treasury believes that collecting only the OMB minimum categories 
of race may mask the effects of SSBCI funds on businesses in 
jurisdictions with a large population of one OMB minimum category of 
race and multiple populations of categories of race, and therefore 
hinder the understanding of program outcomes in these jurisdictions. 
Thus, this interim final rule provides for the reporting of information 
consistent with the OMB data collection standard, using the five 
minimum race categories, in addition to disaggregating the Asian and 
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander categories, which is 
consistent with the approaches used by HHS and the Census Bureau's 
American Community Survey. Treasury will collect information on 
ethnicity consistent with the OMB data collection standard's minimum 
ethnicity categories. For both the race and ethnicity information 
collection, Treasury is providing a response option of ``prefer not to 
respond,'' consistent with the HMDA data collection's ``I do not wish 
to provide this information.'' As businesses may elect not to respond 
by leaving the information request blank, Treasury also provides 
jurisdictions the option to report ``the business did not answer.''
    Treasury also believes that it is important to collect information 
on those that identify as Middle Eastern or North African to understand 
whether SSBCI funds are reaching businesses principally owned by such 
individuals. Currently, people of Middle Eastern or North African 
ancestry are categorized as White under OMB data collection standards. 
Because Treasury must comply with these standards, Treasury is 
collecting information about Middle Eastern or North African ancestry 
through a separate ancestry question. Finally, this interim final rule 
requires jurisdictions to submit the required information using the 
format specified on Treasury's website.\27\

    \27\ See 12 U.S.C. 5706(c).

    We welcome comment on any aspect of this interim final rule.

III. Regulatory Analyses

Executive Orders 12866 and 13563

    Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess costs 
and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety 
effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 
emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of 
reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. 
This interim final rule has been designated a ``significant regulatory 
action,'' although not economically significant, under section 3(f) of 
Executive Order 12866. As explained above, this interim final rule 
institutes reporting requirements to implement, determine compliance 
with, and understand the program outcomes of SSBCI, as reauthorized and 
amended by ARPA. As these reporting requirements focus only on data 
collection, this interim final rule is not economically significant. 
However, we welcome comments on the economic impact of this interim 
final rule. Particularly, Treasury welcomes comments and data on how 
this interim final rule may substantively affect the SSBCI program.

Executive Order 13132

    Executive Order 13132 (entitled Federalism) prohibits an agency 
from publishing any rule that has federalism implications if this 
interim final rule either imposes substantial, direct compliance costs 
on state, local, and Tribal governments, and is not required by 
statute, or preempts state law, unless the agency meets the 
consultation and funding requirements of section 6 of the Executive 
order. This interim final rule does not have federalism implications 
within the meaning of the Executive order and does not impose 
substantial, direct compliance costs on state, local,

[[Page 13632]]

and Tribal governments or preempt state law within the meaning of the 
Executive order. The compliance costs are imposed on state, local, and 
Tribal governments by the Small Business Jobs Act, as amended by ARPA. 
Notwithstanding the above, Treasury has engaged in efforts to consult 
with affected state, local, and Tribal government officials and 
associations in the process of developing this interim final rule. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in section 8(a) of Executive 
Order 13132, Treasury certifies that it has complied with the 
requirements of Executive Order 13132.

Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521) (PRA) 
states that no agency may conduct or sponsor, nor is the respondent 
required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.
    This interim final rule will add annual reporting requirements. 
These collections will increase total annual burden by 13,050 hours: 
The requirements are expected to take 500 jurisdictions 26.10 hours to 
complete for an annual burden of 13,050 hours. Using the standard total 
compensation for accountants and auditors, the estimated cost of this 
information collection is $673,902.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ See Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, 
Occupational Outlook Handbook, Accountants and Auditors, on the 
internet at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132011.htm">https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132011.htm</a>. Base wage 
of $35.37/hour increased by 46 percent to account for fully loaded 
employer cost of employee compensation (benefits, etc.) for a fully 
loaded wage rate of $51.64. 13,050 multiplied by $51.64 equals 
$673,902.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The OMB Control Number for the SSBCI information collection is 
1505-0227. Comments concerning the collections of information should be 
directed to the Office of Recovery Programs, Department of the 
Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20220. Treasury 
welcomes comments on the compliance burdens for the information 
collection under this interim final rule.

Congressional Review Act

    The Administrator of OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs (OIRA) has determined that this is not a major rule for 
purposes of Subtitle E of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement and 
Fairness Act of 1996 (also known as the Congressional Review Act or 
CRA) (5 U.S.C. 804(2) et seq.). Under the CRA, a major rule takes 
effect 60 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register. 5 
U.S.C. 801(a)(3).

Administrative Procedure Act

    The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., 
generally requires public notice and an opportunity for comment before 
a rule becomes effective. However, the APA provides that the 
requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply ``to the extent that there is 
involved . . . a matter relating to agency . . . grants . . . or 
contracts.'' This interim final rule is being issued for purposes of 
implementation, compliance, and understanding the outcomes of the SSBCI 
program. While SSBCI capital funds are not considered federal financial 
assistance for the purposes of 31 U.S.C. subtitle V under the SSBCI 
statute, the SSBCI program resembles other coronavirus relief programs 
that Treasury is implementing. SSBCI capital funds will be disbursed to 
eligible jurisdictions that apply in order to establish small business 
lending and investment programs. This interim final rule sets forth the 
``process necessary to maintain. . . eligibility for federal funds,'' 
id., as well as the ``method[s] by which [jurisdictions] can . . . 
qualify for federal aid,'' and other ``integral part[s] of the grant 
program,'' Center for Auto Safety v. Tiemann, 414 F. Supp. 215, 222 
(D.D.C. 1976). Eligible jurisdictions must submit the annual 
information required by this interim final rule in Treasury's 
prescribed format to remain eligible for SSBCI capital funding. 
Treasury will also use the reported data to determine whether 
jurisdictions are eligible for the SEDI incentive allocation. As a 
result, the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply.
    The APA also provides an exception to notice-and-comment procedures 
``when the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding 
and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) that 
notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or 
contrary to the public interest.'' 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B); see also 5 
U.S.C. 553(d)(3) (creating an exception to the requirement of a 30-day 
delay before the effective date of a rule ``for good cause found and 
published with the rule''). Even if 5 U.S.C. 553 applied, Treasury 
would have good cause under sections 553(b)(3)(B) and 553(d)(3) for not 
complying with these requirements under section 553. ARPA is a law 
responding to a historic economic and public health emergency; it is 
``extraordinary'' legislation about which ``both Congress and the 
President articulated a profound sense of `urgency.' '' Petry v. Block, 
737 F.2d 1193, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1984). In addition, there is an urgent 
need for jurisdictions to undertake the planning necessary to implement 
their SSBCI capital programs. Developing these programs requires an 
understanding of all the program requirements, including the data 
collection and reporting requirements implemented in this interim final 
rule. These requirements are immediately effective but may change when 
the rule is finalized. Without having clarity on how the SSBCI program 
requirements will interact with existing restrictions on lenders' and 
other financial entities' availability to collect this data, 
jurisdictions may have difficulty attracting lenders and other 
financial entities to implement SSBCI programs, which could hinder 
their efforts to deploy the allocation for SEDI-owned and controlled 
businesses as Congress intended. Treasury understands that many 
jurisdictions require immediate rules on which they can rely in order 
to develop sound SSBCI programs. The statutory urgency and practical 
necessity are good cause to forego the ordinary requirements of notice-
and-comment rulemaking.

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) generally requires that when 
an agency issues a proposed rule, or a final rule pursuant to section 
553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act or another law, the agency 
must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that meets the 
requirements of the RFA and publish such analysis in the Federal 
Register. 5 U.S.C. 603, 604. Rules that are exempt from notice and 
comment under the APA are also exempt from the RFA requirements, 
including the requirement to conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis. 
Since this interim final rule is exempt from the notice and comment 
requirements of the APA, Treasury is not required to conduct a 
regulatory flexibility analysis.
