ACTION: Joint notice of proposed rulemaking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: On September 7, 2008, the U.S. Department of Treasury 
(Treasury) entered into senior preferred stock purchase agreements (the 
Agreement or Agreements) with the Federal National Mortgage Association 
(Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie 
Mac), which effectively provide protection to the holders of senior 
debt, subordinated debt, and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued or 
guaranteed by these entities. In light of the financial support 
provided under the Agreements, the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(Board), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of 
Thrift Supervision (OTS) (collectively, the agencies) are

[[Page 63657]]

proposing to adopt a 10 percent risk weight for claims on, and the 
portion of claims guaranteed by, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The 10 
percent risk weight would apply so long as an Agreement remains in 
effect with the respective entity.

DATES: Comments must be received by November 26, 2008.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 7, 2008, Treasury announced the 
establishment of the Government-Sponsored Enterprise Credit Facility to 
ensure credit availability to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Treasury also 
entered into senior preferred stock purchase agreements, which ensure 
that each entity maintains a positive net worth and effectively support 
the holders of debt and MBS issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac. The Agreements enhance market stability by providing 
additional security to debt holders--senior and subordinated--and 
improve mortgage affordability by providing additional confidence to 
investors in MBS guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Treasury 
indicated that these actions were necessary because ambiguities in the 
Congressional charters of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac created a market 
perception of government backing.\1\

    \1\ U.S. Department of Treasury Office of Public Affairs, ``Fact 
Sheet: Treasury Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement,'' 
September 7, 2008. Available at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/pspa_factsheet_090708%20hp1128.pdf">http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under the agencies' general risk-based capital rules, claims on, 
and the portion of claims guaranteed by, U.S. government-sponsored 
agencies receive a 20 percent risk weight.\2\ In light of the 
additional financial support Treasury has committed to provide under 
the Agreements, the agencies believe that a reduced risk weight is 
appropriate for claims on, or guaranteed by, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See 12 CFR part 3, Appendix A, section 3(a)(2) (OCC); 12 CFR 
part 208, Appendix A, section III.C.2.b. and 12 CFR part 225, 
Appendix A section III.C.2.b. (Board); 12 CFR part 325, Appendix A, 
section II.C. (FDIC); and 12 CFR 567.6(a)(ii) (OTS).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Specifically, the agencies are proposing to amend their respective 
general risk-based capital rules to permit banks, bank holding 
companies, and savings associations to assign a 10 percent risk weight 
to claims on, or guaranteed by, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Claims 
include all credit exposures, such as senior and subordinated debt and 
counterparty credit risk exposures, but do not include preferred or 
common stock. This risk weight could be applied to credit exposures 
created on, before, or after September 7, 2008. The 10 percent risk 
weight, which would reflect the reduced credit risk of Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac in light of the Agreements, would apply to these exposures 
so long as an Agreement remains in effect with the respective entity. 
This proposal would not affect the calculation of the leverage ratio 
with respect to these exposures.
    The Board is also proposing a technical amendment to the advanced 
approaches capital rule \3\ to conform a cross reference affected by 
the proposed change to the general risk-based capital rule. The Board, 
FDIC, and OTS are proposing technical revisions to the general risk-
based capital rules that update references to the risk-weight 
categories to reflect this proposal.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 12 CFR part 208, Appendix F (for state member banks) and 12 
CFR part 225, Appendix G (for bank holding companies).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The agencies seek comment on all aspects of this notice of proposed 
rulemaking. In particular, the agencies request comment on the 
potential effects of this proposal on other banking organization claims 
on GSEs, such as Federal Home Loan Bank debt. In that regard, the 
agencies generally request comment on the appropriateness of the 
current 20 percent risk weight on claims on GSEs.

Regulatory Analysis

Executive Order 12866

    Executive Order 12866 requires federal agencies to prepare a 
regulatory impact analysis for agency actions that are found to be 
``significant regulatory actions.'' Significant regulatory actions 
include, among other things, rulemakings that ``have an annual effect 
on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a 
material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, 
local, or tribal governments or communities.'' \4\ Regulatory actions 
that satisfy one or more of these criteria are referred to as 
``economically significant regulatory actions.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Executive Order 12866 (September 30, 1993), 58 FR 51735 
(October 4, 1993), as amended by Executive Order 13258, 67 FR 9385 
(February 28, 2002) and by Executive Order 13422, 72 FR 2763 
(January 23, 2007). For the complete text of the definition of 
``significant regulatory action,'' see E.O. 12866 at Sec.  3(f). A 
``regulatory action'' is ``any substantive action by an agency 
(normally published in the Federal Register) that promulgates or is 
expected to lead to the promulgation of a final rule or regulation, 
including notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed 
rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking.'' E.O. 12866 at 
Sec.  3(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The OCC and OTS have each determined that this notice of proposed 
rulemaking likely would be an economically significant regulatory 
action for purposes of Executive Order 12866. However, in light of the 
exigent market circumstances resulting from the

[[Page 63659]]

immediate need to recognize the support provided by the U.S. Treasury 
Department's senior preferred stock purchase agreements with Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac, and to reduce strain on the capital positions of 
banking organizations that are holding securities issued by or 
guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the issuance of this notice 
of proposed rulemaking is subject to the procedures set forth in 
Section 6(a)(3)(D) of Executive Order 12866.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (Pub. L. 96-
354, Sept. 19, 1980) (RFA) generally requires an agency that is issuing 
a proposed rule to prepare and make available for public comment an 
initial regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the impact of 
the proposed rule on small entities.\5\ The RFA provides that an agency 
is not required to prepare and publish an initial regulatory 
flexibility analysis if the agency certifies that the proposed rule 
will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See 5 U.S.C. 603(a).
    \6\ See 5 U.S.C. 605(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under regulations issued by the Small Business Administration,\7\ a 
small entity includes a bank holding company, commercial bank, or 
savings association with assets of $175 million or less (collectively, 
small banking organizations). The proposed rule would permit a banking 
organization to assign a 10 percent risk weight to claims on, and the 
portion of claims guaranteed by, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The 10 
percent risk weight would apply as long as an Agreement remains in 
effect between the Treasury and the respective entity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See 13 CFR 121.201.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, each agency certifies that 
this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of the small entities it supervises. Accordingly, a 
regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. In making this 
determination, each agency considered the number of small banking 
organizations that currently hold claims on or guaranteed by either 
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the cost of implementing the proposed rule 
for those banking organizations, and the size of the impact on those 
banking organizations' regulatory capital levels.
    The Agencies have determined that a substantial number of small 
banking organizations hold claims on or are guaranteed by Fannie Mae or 
Freddie Mac.\8\ However, the cost for each such a banking organization 
to adjust its systems to implement the proposed rule would not be 
significant since the only change would be a simple mathematical 
computation. Although reducing the risk weight for claims on or 
guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to 10 percent would reduce 
required minimum regulatory capital, the agencies have determined that 
the average change in total risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 risk-based 
capital, and total risk-based capital would not be significant. 
Additionally, the Agencies note that the proposed rule would be 
elective. The proposed rule would apply only to banking organizations 
that choose to take advantage of the proposed 10 percent risk weight. 
Banking organizations not exercising this option would continue to 
apply the current 20 percent risk weight applicable to claims on or 
guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored entities. The proposed rule 
does not impose any new mandatory requirements or burdens. Finally, 
because the proposed rule would apply to all banking organizations, the 
proposed rule does not have a disproportionate effect on small 
entities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ As of June 30, 2008, there were 2,636 small bank holding 
companies, 889 small national banks, 454 small state member banks, 
3,222 small state nonmember banks, and 412 small savings 
associations. The agencies estimate that the proposal would have an 
impact on 0 small bank holding companies, 679 small national banks, 
420 small state member banks, 2,903 small state nonmember banks, and 
350 small savings associations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3506), each agency has reviewed the proposed rule to 
assess any information collections. There are no collections of 
information as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act in the notice of 
proposed rulemaking.

OCC and OTS Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 Determinations

    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Public Law 
104-4 (UMRA) requires that an agency prepare a budgetary impact 
statement before promulgating a rule that includes a Federal mandate 
that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100 million 
or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year. (The 
inflation adjusted threshold is $133 million or more.) If a budgetary 
impact statement is required, section 205 of the UMRA also requires an 
agency to identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory 
alternatives before promulgating a rule. The OCC and OTS each 
determined that its proposed rule will not result in expenditures by 
State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector, of $133 million or more in any one year. Accordingly, 
neither OCC nor OTS has prepared a budgetary impact statement or 
specifically addressed the regulatory alternatives considered.
Solicitation of Comments on Use of Plain Language
    Section 722 of the GLBA required the Federal banking agencies to 
use plain language in all proposed and final rules published after 
January 1, 2000. The Federal banking agencies invite comment on how to 
make this proposed rule easier to understand. For example:
    <bullet> Have we organized the material to suit your needs? If not, 
how could the rule be more clearly stated?
    <bullet> Are the requirements in the rule clearly stated? If not, 
how could the rule be more clearly stated?
    <bullet> Do the regulations contain technical language or jargon 
that is not clear? If so, which language requires clarification?
    <bullet> Would a different format (grouping and order of sections, 
use of headings, paragraphing) make the regulation easier to 
understand? If so, what changes would make the regulation easier to 
understand?
    <bullet> Would more, but shorter, sections be better? If so, which 
sections should be changed?
    <bullet> What else could we do to make the regulation easier to 
understand?

    II. * * *
    A. * * *
    1. Under the risk-based capital framework, a bank's balance 
sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet 
items are assigned to one of six broad risk categories according to 
the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the 
collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each category is then 
multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that category. The 
resulting weighted values from each of the six risk categories are 
added together and this sum is the risk-weighted assets total that, 
as adjusted,\10\ comprises the denominator of the risk-based capital 
ratio.

    C. * * *
    The risk-based capital framework contains six risk weight 
categories--0 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent, 50 percent, 100 
percent and 200 percent. In general, if a particular item can be 
placed in more than one risk category, it is assigned to the 
category that has the lowest risk weight. An explanation of the 
components of each category follows:
* * * * *
    Category 2--10 Percent Risk Weight. This category includes 
claims on, or portions of claims guaranteed by, the Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the Federal National 
Mortgage Corporation (Fannie Mae), so long as the U.S. Department of 
Treasury's Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of

Mae, respectively. However, at its option, a bank may choose to 
assign claims described in this category to the 20 percent risk 
weight category.

Category 3--20 Percent Risk Weight.

* * * * *
    b. Except as provided in the ten percent risk weight category,

issued or guaranteed by OECD central governments, U.S. Government 
agencies, or U.S. Government-sponsored agencies. Also included in 
the 20 percent risk weight category are portions of claims that are 
conditionally guaranteed by OECD central governments and U.S. 
Government agencies, as well as portions of local currency claims 
that are conditionally guaranteed by non-OECD central governments to 
the extent that the bank has liabilities booked in that currency.
    \34\ For risk-based capital purposes, U.S. Government-sponsored 
agencies are defined as agencies originally established or

[[Page 63662]]

chartered by the U.S. Government to serve public purposes specified 
by the U.S. Congress but whose debt obligations are not explicitly 
guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. 
These agencies include the Farm Credit System, the Federal Home Loan 
Bank System, the Student Loan Marketing Association, Freddie Mac, 
and Fannie Mae. For risk-based capital purposes, claims on U.S. 
Government-sponsored agencies also include capital stock in a 
Federal Home Loan Bank that is held as a condition of membership in 
that bank.
* * * * *
    Category 4--50 Percent Risk Weight.
* * * * *
    Category 5--100 Percent Risk Weight.
