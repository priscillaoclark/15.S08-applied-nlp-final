Recordkeeping Requirements for Qualified Financial Contracts

AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FDIC is adopting a final rule establishing recordkeeping
requirements for qualified financial contracts (QFCs) held by insured
depository institutions in a troubled condition as defined in this
rule. The appendix to the rule requires an institution in a troubled
condition, upon written notification by the FDIC, to produce
immediately at the close of processing of the institution's business
day, for a period provided in the notification, the electronic files
for certain position level and counterparty level data; electronic or
written lists of QFC counterparty and portfolio location identifiers,
certain affiliates of the institution and the institution's
counterparties to QFC transactions, contact information and
organizational charts for key personnel involved in QFC activities, and
contact information for vendors for such activities; and copies of key
agreements and related documents for each QFC.

DATES: This final rule is effective January 21, 2009.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    QFCs are certain financial contracts that have been defined in the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) and receive special treatment
by the FDIC in the event of the failure of an insured depository
institution (institution). The special treatment of QFCs after the
FDIC's appointment as receiver or conservator for a failed institution
initially was codified in the FDI Act as part of the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) \1\
and places certain restrictions on the FDIC as receiver \2\ for a
failed institution that held QFCs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Public Law No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 514 (August 9, 1989).
    \2\ Most of the restrictions applicable to the treatment of QFCs
by an FDIC receiver also apply to the FDIC in its conservatorship
capacity. See U.S.C. 1821(e)(8), (9), (10), and (11). While the
treatment of QFCs by an FDIC conservator is not identical to the
treatment of QFCs in a receivership, see 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)(E) and
(10)(B)(i) and (ii), for purposes of this preamble we intend
reference to the FDIC in its receivership capacity to include its
role as conservator under this statutory authority.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FDI Act identifies QFCs using the statutory definition of five
specific financial contracts. This statutory list of QFCs consists of
securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts,
repurchase agreements, and swap agreements.\3\ The FDIC also may define
other similar agreements as QFCs by rule or order.\4\ In addition, a
master agreement that governs any contracts in these five categories is
treated as a QFC,\5\ as are security agreements that ensure the
performance of a contract from the five enumerated categories.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)(D)(ii)-(vi).
    \4\ 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)(D)(i). The FDIC has provided clarifying
definitions for repurchase agreements and swap agreements in 12 CFR
360.5.
    \5\ 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)(D)(ii)(XI), (iii)(IX), (iv)(IV),
(v)(V), and (vi)(V).
    \6\ 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)(D)(ii)(XII), (iii)(X), (iv)(V),
(v)(VI), and (vi)(VI).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under the FDI Act and other U.S. insolvency statutes, a party to
QFCs with the insolvent entity can exercise its contractual right to
terminate QFCs and offset or net out any amounts due between the
parties and apply any pledged collateral for payment.\7\ Under the
Bankruptcy Code, this right is immediate upon initiation of bankruptcy
proceedings, while under the FDI Act, counterparties cannot exercise
this contractual right until after 5 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the
business day following the appointment of the FDIC as receiver.\8\ By
contrast, parties to most other contracts with insured institutions
cannot terminate the contracts based upon the appointment of the FDIC
as receiver.\9\ The special rights granted by the FDI Act to QFC
counterparties are designed to protect the stability of the financial
system and to reduce the potential for cascading interrelated defaults.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8); 11 U.S.C. 555 (securities contracts),
556 (commodities and forward contracts), 559 (repurchase
agreements), 560 (swap agreements), and 561 (master netting
agreements).
    \8\ See 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(10)(B).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If QFC counterparties were unable to terminate and liquidate their
positions in a timely manner after the failure of the institution, they
would be exposed to market risks and uncertainty regarding the ultimate
resolution of QFCs. Absent the ability to terminate a QFC in a timely
manner when the counterparty becomes insolvent (which may include
exercising rights to offset positions, net payments, and use collateral
to cover amounts due), the potential for fluctuation in the value of
the QFCs from changes in interest rates and other market factors may
create market uncertainty that could lead to broader market
disruptions. Consequently, while the Bankruptcy

[[Page 78163]]

Code and the FDI Act generally do not contain provisions covering
creditor or counterparty liquidity concerns arising from insolvency
proceedings, those statutes do contain safeguards for counterparties
that have entered into certain financial contracts under the Bankruptcy
Code and the FDI Act.\10\ Both of these statutes treat these types of
financial contracts differently from other contracts that an entity may
have entered into prior to bankruptcy or failure.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ 11 U.S.C. 555, 556, 559, 560, and 561; 12 U.S.C.
1821(e)(8).
    \11\ Without such protections for financial contracts and QFCs
under the Bankruptcy Code and the FDI Act, respectively, a contract
generally will be subject to an automatic stay upon the filing of a
bankruptcy petition or the appointment of the FDIC as receiver. See
11 U.S.C. 361; 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Congress, however, recognized the tension between the need of the
FDIC as receiver to efficiently resolve a failed institution and the
desire to maintain stability in the financial markets. Thus, the
treatment of QFCs for failed institutions under the FDI Act provides
the FDIC with limited flexibility in crafting a resolution with respect
to the institution's QFC portfolio. These provisions allow the FDIC to
reduce losses to the deposit insurance fund and retain the value of the
failed institution's portfolio, while minimizing the potential for
market disruptions that could occur with the liquidation of a large QFC
portfolio.
    After its appointment as receiver, the FDIC has three options in
managing the institution's QFC portfolio: (1) Transfer the QFCs to
another financial institution, (2) repudiate the QFCs, or (3) retain
the QFCs in the receivership. Within certain constraints, the FDIC can
apply different options to QFCs with different counterparties.
    First, the receiver may transfer a QFC to any other financial
institution not currently in default, including but not limited to
foreign banks, uninsured banks, and bridge banks or conservatorships
operated by the FDIC. If the receiver transfers a QFC to another
financial institution, the counterparty cannot exercise its contractual
right to terminate the QFC based solely on the transfer, the
insolvency, or the appointment of the receiver.
    Second, the FDIC as receiver may repudiate a QFC, within a
reasonable period of time, if the receiver determines that the contract
is burdensome.\12\ If the receiver repudiates the QFC, it must pay
actual direct compensatory damages, which may include the normal and
reasonable costs of cover or other reasonable measure of damages used
in the industry for such claims, calculated as of the date of
repudiation.\13\ If the receiver determines to transfer or repudiate a
QFC, all other QFCs entered into between the failed institution and
that counterparty, as well as those QFCs entered into with any of that
counterparty's affiliates, must be transferred to the same financial
institution or repudiated at the same time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(1).
    \13\ 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(3)(C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Third, the FDIC as receiver may retain a QFC in the receivership.
This option would allow the counterparty to terminate the contract. If
a QFC is terminated by the counterparty or repudiated by the receiver,
the counterparty may exercise any contractual right to net any payment
the counterparty owes to the receiver on a QFC against any payment owed
by the receiver to the counterparty on a different QFC.
    The FDIC as receiver has very little time to choose among these
three options. Under the FDI Act, the FDIC as receiver has until 5 p.m.
(Eastern Time) on the business day following the date of its
appointment as receiver to make its decision to transfer any QFCs.
During this period, counterparties are prohibited from terminating or
otherwise exercising any contractual rights triggered by the
appointment of the receiver under the QFC agreements. In effect, the
same time limitation applies to repudiation because, after the
expiration of this brief stay, counterparties are free to exercise any
contractual right to terminate the QFCs and avoid the FDIC's power to
repudiate. If the FDIC as receiver decides to transfer any QFCs, it
must take steps reasonably calculated to provide notice of the transfer
of the QFCs of the failed institution to the relevant counterparties,
who are prohibited from exercising such rights thereafter.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ See 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(10)(B). This limited time frame in
which QFC counterparties are stayed from acting is in contrast to
parties to other contracts with a failed institution which may be
required to continue to perform by a receiver, and the receiver may
stay a party from terminating such other contracts subject to
monetary damages or default for up to 90 days.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To make a well-informed decision on these three options, the FDIC
needs access to information such as the types of QFCs, the
counterparties and their affiliates, the notional amount and net
position on the contracts, the purpose of the contracts, the maturity
dates, and the collateral pledged for the contracts. Given the FDI
Act's short time frame for such decision by the FDIC in the case of a
QFC portfolio of any significant size or complexity, it may be
difficult to obtain and process the large amount of information
necessary for an informed decision by the FDIC as receiver unless that
information is readily available to the FDIC in a format that permits
the FDIC to quickly and efficiently carry out an appropriate financial
and legal analysis. The absence of adequate information for decision-
making by the FDIC as receiver increases the likelihood that, in a
failed bank situation, QFCs will be left in the receivership or
repudiated, instead of transferred to open institutions or a bridge
bank.
    In light of the large volume of information concerning QFCs that a
receiver must process in the limited time frame set forth in the FDI
Act, the FDIC is establishing QFC recordkeeping requirements for
institutions in a troubled condition, as described below.

 II. The Proposed Rule

    In 2005, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection
Act \15\ was enacted, with section 908 of the Act authorizing the FDIC,
in consultation with the other Federal banking agencies, to set
recordkeeping requirements for QFCs held in institutions determined to
be in a ``troubled condition.'' \16\ Consistent with this statutory
authority, the FDIC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for
recordkeeping requirements for QFCs (NPR), which was published in the
Federal Register on July 28, 2008. See 73 FR 43635. The NPR invited
comments from the public on all aspects of the proposal and in response
to certain specific questions. In issuing the NPR, the FDIC stated that
the QFC recordkeeping requirements in the proposed rule included
position and counterparty data fields that likely were maintained by
institutions as part of their risk management of capital markets
activities. Given the financial exposures presented by QFCs and related
counterparty risks and supervisory considerations, and after
consultation with the other Federal banking agencies, the FDIC
determined that the recordkeeping requirements in the proposed rule
were consistent with safe and sound banking practices by insured
depository institutions holding QFCs.

III. Summary of Comments

    The American Bankers Association (ABA), The Clearing House
Association (The Clearing House), the Independent Community Bankers of
America (ICBA), and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA) submitted comments on the NPR. These comments focused on issues
regarding the (1) the institutions covered by the rule, (2) the
requirement that QFC ``position level'' data be reported under the data
fields in Table A1 of Appendix A, (3) the requirement that QFC
counterparty level data be reported under the data fields in Table A2
of Appendix A, (4) the requirement of a standardized reporting format
for the reporting of both position level and counterparty-specific
data, (5) the proposed time frame for compliance, and (6) the
differences between the QFC reporting requirements for purposes of the
Basel II Advanced Approaches final rule and the QFC reporting
requirements under Tables A1 and A2 of the proposed rule.
    A. Institutions Covered under the Rule. Certain comment letters on
the proposed rule suggested that the FDIC exclude from the definition
of ``troubled condition'' institutions with a composite supervisory
rating of 3 under the Uniform Financial Institution Rating System,
because complying with the requirements of the rule could signal to
employees, other institutions, and eventually the public that the
institution is in financial distress. It was suggested by one commenter
that ``3'' rated institutions not be required to comply with the rule
unless the institution either holds more than $10 billion in assets or
its primary federal regulator agrees that the institution should be
required to comply. Another comment letter suggested that the rule
apply only to institutions that have been found to have poor QFC risk
management practices in place for their portfolios, or unsustainable
QFC concentrations. Another comment letter suggested that because the
use of QFCs by smaller community banks is limited, the rule should not
apply to institutions with less than $5 billion in assets, or with
fewer than ten open QFC positions on the balance sheet at any one time.
    Under section 370.1(c) of the proposed rule, consistent with the
Congressional directive, the FDIC provided that only institutions that
were in a ``troubled condition'' would be covered by the rule. The FDIC
based its definition of that term in the proposed rule on its current
definition of ``troubled condition'' in 12 CFR 303.101(c), which was
promulgated to implement 12 U.S.C. 1831i, regarding the Federal banking
agencies' approval of the appointment of directors and senior executive
officers of institutions. The proposed rule added one new criterion to
that definition and expanded another criterion in the current
definition to reflect the FDIC's data needs in its role as receiver
under the FDI Act. The new criterion was that, notwithstanding the
composite rating of the institution by that agency in its most recent
report of examination, the institution is determined by the appropriate
Federal banking agency, or the FDIC in consultation with the
appropriate Federal banking agency, to be experiencing a significant
deterioration of capital or significant funding difficulties or
liquidity stress. Another criterion was expanded to include
institutions with a 3 composite rating and total consolidated assets
over $10 billion.
    The FDIC has determined that it is appropriate to include
institutions with a 3 composite rating and total consolidated assets
over $10 billion, because these institutions are likely to pose risks
to the deposit insurance fund arising from QFC activities. The FDIC has
similar concerns regarding risks to the deposit insurance fund arising
from any insured depository institution with QFCs that is experiencing
a significant deterioration of capital or significant funding
difficulties or liquidity stress, irrespective of the institution's
supervisory rating. Based on its experience in its receivership
capacity, the FDIC believes it is prudent to give institutions facing
deteriorating conditions sufficient time to comply with this rule.
Accordingly, the FDIC believes it is imperative that institutions with
a supervisory rating of 3 and total assets of $10 billion or greater
and/or experiencing a significant deterioration of capital or
significant funding difficulties or liquidity stress develop and
maintain the QFC position level and counterparty-specific data fields
shown in Tables A1 and A2 of the Appendix to this rule.
    The FDIC does not believe that the ``signaling'' problem expressed
in certain comment letters justifies exempting certain institutions in
a troubled condition from maintaining QFC information consistent with
safe and sound practices as required by this rule. The FDIC's request
for information would be non-public, as are many other supervisory
directives. Also, the recordkeeping requirements in this final rule do
not impose any restrictions on the business operations of institutions
covered by this rule.
    B. QFC Position Level-Specific Data Fields (Table A1 of Appendix
A). The ISDA and The Clearing House comment letters indicated that
institutions usually do not maintain and aggregate the position-level
information requested in Table A1 of Appendix A of the proposed rule,
but instead aggregate information by counterparty. As noted in these
comment letters, the FDIC's receivership authority under section
11(e)(9) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. Sec.  1821(e)(9), requires that the
FDIC treat all QFC contracts with a single counterparty and its
affiliates similarly when deciding whether to transfer, repudiate or
retain the QFC portfolio of a failed institution. Accordingly, in their
view, transaction-level QFC position information should be unnecessary
for the FDIC's decision-making process. These comment letters also
indicated that the ``purpose of the position'' field be eliminated from
Table A1 because institutions typically do not record this information
for specific QFC positions and the purpose of a QFC position can change
in dynamic markets. The Clearing House also indicated that providing a
full transaction-level understanding of the broad range of QFCs would
entail different recordkeeping requirements for specific QFCs, thereby
resulting in increased implementation complexity and associated costs.
    The FDIC has determined that the position-level QFC data fields in
Table A1 of the Appendix to this final rule provide information
necessary to enable the FDIC to meet its obligations under the least
cost test for closed bank resolutions under section 13(c)(4) of the FDI
Act, 12 U.S.C. Sec.  1823(c)(4). The information required in Table A1
(e.g., the current market value of the QFC position, the type and
purpose of the position, and the notional or principal amount of the
position) are important to the evaluation of the costs associated with
the FDIC as receiver's decision to (1) transfer the QFCs to another
financial institution, (2) repudiate the QFCs, or (3) retain the QFCs
in the receivership.
    As an example of the importance of position-level QFC data to the
FDIC's least-cost resolution decisions in its receivership capacity, if
one of the counterparty's QFC positions is a forward sale contract (a
contract that allows the institution to sell assets at a set price in
the future), and the institution has amassed a $50 million ``pipeline''
of assets for future delivery under the contract, the FDIC as receiver
may realize significant financial benefits by transferring the forward
contract together with the mortgage loan pipeline

[[Page 78165]]

that it hedges. These financial benefits may, on the whole, exceed the
savings that the receivership might realize if all of that
counterparty's QFCs remained with the receivership and the loan
pipeline were sold without the hedge. In another example, information
identifying the ``booking location'' of individual QFCs would enable
the FDIC to classify QFCs by foreign branch location and thereby allow
the FDIC to evaluate the potential effect of ``ring-fencing,'' whereby
foreign governments use foreign assets held by a failed U.S.
institution to satisfy claims of depositors and creditors in that same
jurisdiction. Identifying the type and purpose of QFCs on both an
individual transaction level and on an aggregate basis will permit the
FDIC to assess the impact that QFC determinations may have on a
counterparty's other banking relationships with a failed institution.
For example, knowledge of how particular QFCs fit into a counterparty's
business with the institution might lead the FDIC to transfer the QFCs
to a bridge bank in order to maintain the value of a customer
relationship that otherwise would be destroyed if QFC determinations
were made without regard to a QFC's purpose. As a specific
illustration, a QFC might include an interest rate swap between an
institution and a borrower, which is designed to tailor the interest
payment due on the loan. Position-level QFC data would permit the FDIC
to make an informed judgment concerning the least-cost disposition of
the customer relationship. Also, position-level data would enable the
FDIC to consider clearinghouse arrangements used for settling trades,
which may influence the disposition of other QFCs settled through the
same clearinghouse.
    Information provided in Table A1 also may be needed by the FDIC as
receiver to determine how to react to the termination of contracts by a
counterparty in the event that such contracts are not transferred. A
counterparty is under no obligation to terminate all of its contracts
with the FDIC as receiver. Accordingly, in this situation, counterparty
level data will be of little value, and the FDIC as receiver must
obtain position-level data in order to satisfy the termination
provisions of the contract.
    As discussed below, the FDIC has addressed concerns related to the
position-specific data fields in Table A1 through a more flexible
approach for institutions' formats for reporting the QFC position-
specific data fields in Table A1. In support of this approach, The
Clearing House comment letter provided that:

    Except as noted above, each piece of data set forth in the
Proposal is generally maintained by each institution in some form.
However, there is no reason that an institution would need to
assemble all of the information required by the Proposal into a
single, centralized database, whether upon demand or on an on-going
basis.\17\

    \17\ Letter to the FDIC from The Clearing House, dated October
30, 2008, p. 10. Similar comments were provided in the letter to the
FDIC from ISDA dated October 31, 2008, p. 2; and the letter to the
FDIC from the American Bankers Association dated September 26, 2008,
p. 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The introduction to Table A1 in the Appendix has been revised to state
that no later than three business days after the institution's receipt
of the written notification from the FDIC under section 371.1(c) of
this Part, the institution must provide the FDIC with (i) a directory
of the electronic files that will be used by the institution to
maintain the position level data found in Table A1 and (ii) a point of
contact at the institution should the FDIC have follow-up questions
concerning this information.
    In response to certain comment letters regarding whether the FDIC
needs the data field in Table A1 that covers the ``purpose of the
position'' for QFCs (e.g., whether the QFC position is being used for
hedging or trading purposes), the FDIC has determined that this data
field is necessary for it to quickly ascertain the potential impact of
its receivership options regarding certain QFC positions.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ The information required for the ``purpose of position''
field is similar to information required under Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Statements No. 133 and 161. Under these
Statements, disclosures must be made as to whether derivatives are
held for speculative purposes or risk mitigation, the types of risk
mitigation strategies implemented, and how the use of derivatives
affects the institutions financial position and performance.
Accordingly, institutions should be able to identify the purpose of
entering into QFC contracts to meet these accounting requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    C. QFC Counterparty-Specific Data Fields (Table A2 of Appendix A).
The Clearing House and ISDA comment letters acknowledged the
significance of the counterparty-specific data fields in Table A2 of
Appendix A of the proposed rule. On this point, The Clearing House
comment letter stated:

    A focus on counterparty-level data is also consistent with the
way in which institutions manage exposure and risk in their QFC
portfolios. Financial institutions generally manage trading
relationships on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis rather than on
a trade-by-trade basis. To assess the risks and benefits that a
trading relationship presents to an institution, the institution
must be able to evaluate, on an on-going basis, aggregate
information for that particular counterparty. In other words, while
credit and market risk and other aspects of a trading relationship
with a single counterparty are, of course, monitored through various
systems, the primary factor a depository institution must assess in
evaluating the immediate loss that it would suffer if a counterparty
were to default is the institution's aggregate position vis-
[agrave]-vis that counterparty. Existing information systems are
already built with this objective in mind.\19\

    \19\ Letter to the FDIC from The Clearing House, dated October
30, 2008.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ISDA comment letter provided similar justification for the data
fields required in Table A2 of Appendix A of the proposed rule.
    D. Reporting Format for Data Fields Required in the Rule. The ABA
commented that since banking organizations currently maintain QFC
position-specific data in various formats and across various databases,
the requirements in Table A1 and A2 of the Appendix of the proposed
rule would require costly system upgrades and potential contract
renegotiations with service providers. The ABA recommended instead that
covered institutions be allowed to provide the FDIC the information in
its existing format and include a ``roadmap'' of where the required
information can be found.
    The proposed rule did not mandate a specific format for the
reporting by institutions in a troubled condition of the position level
specific data fields in Table A1; instead, the FDIC provided a
functional criterion that the data fields must be accessible for FDIC's
monitoring purposes. In conjunction with the appropriate Federal
banking agency, the FDIC will discuss with such institutions whether
the existing electronic data files maintained by the respective
institutions are in a suitable format to produce information required
under the data fields in Table A1. Similarly, for purposes of the
counterparty-level data fields in Table A2, the final rule requires
that such data fields must be maintained in an electronic file in a
format acceptable to the FDIC.
    The FDIC also notes that its data maintenance requirements for QFCs
are consistent with recommendations that have been developed by
industry participants to measure and safeguard risks to financial
institutions arising from the OTC derivatives market. The recent report
from the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group III (CRMPG III)
recommends various measures to safeguard risks to financial
institutions arising from counterparty credit risk.\20\ Significantly,
the CRMPG III report stated:

    The Policy Group recommends that large integrated financial
intermediaries ensure that their credit systems are adequate to
compile detailed exposures to each of their institutional
counterparties on an end-of-day basis by the opening of business the
subsequent morning. In addition, the Policy Group recommends that
large integrated financial intermediaries ensure their credit
systems are capable of compiling, on an ad hoc basis and within a
matter of hours, detailed and accurate estimates of market and
credit risk exposure data across all counterparties and the risk
parameters set out below. Within a slightly longer time frame this
information should be expandable to include: (1) The directionality
of the portfolio and of individual trades; (2) the incorporation of
additional risk types, including contingent exposures and second and
third order exposures (for example, SIVs, ABS, etc.); and (3) such
other information as would be required to optimally manage risk
exposures to a troubled counterparty.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ Id. at 81.

    The FDIC views the recordkeeping requirements contained in part 371
as consistent with the Policy Group's recommendation.
    For purposes of minimizing the recordkeeping burdens for community
banks under this final rule, we have provided in the Appendix of the
final rule that for institutions in a troubled condition with less than
twenty open QFC positions upon receipt of the written notification from
the FDIC under part 371 and the Appendix, the data required in Tables
A1 and A2 may be recorded and maintained in a written format so long as
the data are capable of being updated on a daily basis.
    E. Time Period for Compliance. Three of the four comment letters
stated that the proposed 30-day time period to comply after being
notified of being in a troubled condition would be too short,
especially if institutions had to change their systems or renegotiate
contracts with third party service providers. One suggestion was to
allow a ``roadmap'' compliance system, as discussed above, in which an
institution would provide the FDIC a roadmap as to how the information
could be collected when needed rather than actually assembling and
providing the information on a regular basis. A second suggestion was
to permit an institution to formally request an extension of time for
compliance. In addition, the ABA comment letter recommended that the
QFC data be updated only weekly because many of the large broker
dealers operate global, around-the-clock operations and would have
difficulty updating their files daily.
    In response to these comments, in order to meet the statutory
deadlines for decisions on QFCs upon the appointment of the FDIC as
receiver for an institution in a troubled condition under section
11(e)(10) of the FDI Act, FDIC staff has determined that an initial 60
day compliance deadline. However, the FDIC will permit institutions to
request additional extensions of this deadline, which the FDIC may
grant after review on a case-by-case basis. Institutions should submit
a request for an extension to the FDIC at least 15 days prior to the
deadline for its compliance with the requirements of this rule, and the
institution's request should contain the reasons why the extension is
needed.
    F. Conflict with Basel II implementation. The ABA comment letter
suggested that implementing the QFC recordkeeping rule and the Basel II
Advanced Approaches final rule at the same time would be overly
burdensome and ineffective; therefore, either the QFC rules should
``piggyback'' the Basel II rules or institutions should be able to use
the same information systems for both.
    The FDIC and the other Federal banking agencies have developed
reporting schedules for purposes of implementing the Basel II Advanced
Approaches final rule. The FDIC has determined that the relevant
schedules that have been developed for Basel II implementation do not
contain counterparty-level data that Table A2 would require nor the
specific data fields presented in Table A1 of Appendix A.\22\ Instead,
these schedules report information aggregated across multiple
transactions and counterparties. Accordingly, the interagency Basel II
schedules for derivative contract exposures are neither duplicative nor
appropriate for the FDIC's data needs in its receivership capacity
under the FDI Act. In addition, several of the QFC categories under the
FDI Act are not covered explicitly under the Basel II reporting
schedules. It also is likely that fewer than twenty banks in the United
States will implement the Basel II Advanced Approaches final rule for
purposes of their risk-based capital requirements. Accordingly, the
FDIC has determined not to change the proposed rule in this respect.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. The Final Rule

    The final rule differs from the proposal by providing in section
371.1(c) that the institutions subject to this rule must comply within
60 days after they receive written notification from their appropriate
Federal banking agency or the FDIC. The FDIC may, at its discretion,
grant one or more extensions of time for compliance with this rule. No
single extension may be for a period of more than 30 days. Such
institutions may request an extension of time by submitting a written
request to the FDIC at least 15 days prior to the deadline for its
compliance with the requirements of this part. In addition, the final
rule provides that not later than three business days after the
institution's receipt of the written notification from the FDIC under
section 371.1(c) of this part, the institution must provide the FDIC
with (i) a directory of the electronic files that will be used by the
institution to maintain the position level data found in Table A1 and
(ii) a point of contact at the institution should the FDIC have follow-
up questions concerning this information. Section 371.5 has been added
to clarify that violating the terms or requirements of part 371 and
Appendix A constitutes a violation of a regulation and may subject the
institution to enforcement actions under section 8 of the FDI Act (12
U.S.C. 1818).
    Furthermore, a ``de minimus'' provision has been included to
provide that for institutions in a troubled condition with less than
twenty open QFC positions upon receipt of the written notification from
the FDIC or the institution's appropriate Federal banking agency under
Part 371 and this Appendix, the data required in Tables A1 and A2 is
not required to be recorded and maintained in electronic form as would
otherwise be required by this part, so long as all required information
is capable of being updated on a daily basis. If at any point in time
after receiving such notification an institution has twenty or more
open QFC positions, it must within 60 days after that first occurs,
comply with all provisions of part 371.
    Other changes to the proposed rule are: (1) The change of the
designated part of the FDIC's codified regulations for this rule from
part 370 for the proposed to part 371 for the final rule; (2) as
recommended in ISDA's comment letter, the penultimate data field in
Table A2 will read: ``Counterparty's collateral excess or deficiency
with respect to all of the institution's positions with each
counterparty, as determined under each applicable

[[Page 78167]]

agreement including thresholds and haircuts where applicable;'' and (3)
also as recommended in ISDA's comment letter, the second bullet item
under section B.1 will read: ``A list of the affiliates of the
counterparties that are also counterparties to QFC transactions with
the institution or its affiliates, and the specific master netting
agreements, if any, under which they are counterparties.''
    Section 371.1 provides that this part applies to insured depository
institutions that are in a troubled condition, as defined in section
371.2(f), and that such institutions shall comply with this part (1)
within 60 days after written notification by the institution's
appropriate Federal banking agency or the FDIC that it is in a troubled
condition, or (2) within a period requested by the institution and
approved by the FDIC for an extension of this compliance deadline at
least 15 days prior to the deadline.
    Section 371.2 provides definitions for purposes of this part. In
particular, ``troubled condition'' means any insured depository
institution that (1) has a composite rating, as determined by its
appropriate Federal banking agency in its most recent report of
examination, of 3 (only for insured depository institutions with total
consolidated assets of ten billion dollars or greater), 4, or 5 under
the Uniform Financial Institution Rating System, or in the case of an
insured branch of a foreign bank, an equivalent rating; (2) is subject
to a proceeding initiated by the FDIC for termination or suspension of
deposit insurance; (3) is subject to a cease-and-desist order or
written agreement issued by the appropriate Federal banking agency, as
defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(q), that requires action to improve the
financial condition of the insured depository institution or is subject
to a proceeding initiated by the appropriate Federal banking agency
which contemplates the issuance of an order that requires action to
improve the financial condition of the insured depository institution,
unless otherwise informed in writing by the appropriate Federal banking
agency; (4) is informed in writing by the insured depository
institution's appropriate Federal banking agency that it is in troubled
condition for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1831i on the basis of the
institution's most recent report of condition or report of examination,
or other information available to the institution's appropriate Federal
banking agency; or (5) is determined by the appropriate Federal banking
agency or the FDIC in consultation with the appropriate Federal banking
agency to be experiencing a significant deterioration of capital or
significant funding difficulties or liquidity stress, notwithstanding
the composite rating of the institution by its appropriate Federal
banking agency in its most recent report of examination.
    As required by the statutory authority for the FDIC's promulgation
of this final rule for QFC recordkeeping by insured depository
institutions in a ``troubled condition,'' we have determined that the
definition of ``troubled condition'' in this final rule is consistent
with the current definition of ``troubled condition'' in 12 CFR
303.101(c), and supplements the criteria in that definition with
certain additional criteria that reflect the FDIC's concern that
institutions in a troubled condition need to produce necessary QFC data
for purposes of the FDIC meeting its statutory obligations under
section 11(e) of the FDI Act, in the event of the failure of any such
institution. The third and fourth criteria of the term ``troubled
condition'' as defined in final rule are similar to criteria for the
definition of that term in other FDIC rules and the rules of the other
Federal banking agencies (which generally implement 12 U.S.C. 1831i,
regarding the Federal banking agencies' approval of appointment of
directors and senior executive officers of institutions).\23\ However,
the first, second, and fifth criteria for the definition of ``troubled
condition'' in the proposed rule differ from the other agencies' rules
that implement 12 U.S.C. 1831i.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ See 12 CFR 303.101(c) (FDIC), 12 CFR. 5.51(c)(6) (OCC), 12
CFR 225.71(d) (FRB); and 12 CFR 563.555 (OTS).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Consistent with the FDIC's and the other Federal banking agencies'
definition of ``troubled condition'' for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1831i,
the first criterion of the definition of ``troubled condition'' in this
proposed rule includes institutions with a composite rating, as
determined by its appropriate Federal banking agency in its most recent
examination, of 4 or 5 under the Uniform Financial Institution Rating
System, or in the case of an insured branch of a foreign bank, an
equivalent rating. However, for purposes of this first criterion for
``troubled condition'' in this proposed rule, the FDIC has included any
insured depository institution with total consolidated assets of ten
billion dollars or greater and a composite rating, as determined by its
appropriate Federal banking agency in its most recent examination, of 3
under the Uniform Financial Institution Rating System. The inclusion of
institutions of such asset size with a composite rating of 3 reflects
the risks to the deposit insurance fund arising from large institutions
with QFC portfolios for which the appropriate Federal banking agency
has assigned a composite rating of 3.
    The second criterion of the definition of ``troubled condition'' in
this proposed rule reflects the FDIC's responsibility to terminate the
deposit insurance of institutions that pose unreasonable risk to the
deposit insurance fund. Similarly, the fifth criterion of this
definition is based on circumstances that create a significant risk
that an institution may require the appointment of the FDIC as
receiver.
    Section 371.3 provides that the records required to be maintained
by an insured depository institution for QFCs under this part (except
for records that must be maintained through electronic files under
Appendix A of this part) may be maintained in any form, including in an
electronic file, provided that the records are updated at least daily.
Records not maintained in written form must be capable of being
reproduced or printed in written form. Records must be made available
upon written request by the institution's appropriate Federal banking
agency or the FDIC immediately at the close of processing of the
institution's business day, for a period provided in that written
request. The report will contain information as of the close of
business on the report day. Insured depository institutions that are in
a troubled condition as defined in section 371.2(f) shall continue to
maintain records required to comply with this part for a period of one
year after the date that the appropriate Federal banking agency
notifies the institution that it is no longer in a troubled condition
as defined in section 371.2(f). If an insured depository institution
that has been determined by the appropriate Federal banking agency to
be in a troubled condition ceases to exist as an insured depository
institution as a result of a merger or a similar transaction into an
insured depository institution that is not in a troubled condition
immediately following the acquisition, the obligation to comply with
this part will terminate when the institution in a troubled condition
ceases to exist as an insured depository institution.
    Section 371.4 provides that for each QFC for which an insured
depository institution is a party or is subject to a master netting
agreement involving the QFC, that institution must maintain records as
listed under Appendix A of this part.
    Section 371.5 was added to the final rule to clarify that violating
the terms or

[[Page 78168]]

requirements of part 371 and Appendix A constitutes a violation of a
regulation and subjects the participating entity to enforcement actions
under section 8 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818).

V. Appendix A of the Final Rule: QFC Recordkeeping Requirements

    Appendix A to part 371 sets forth the specific QFC recordkeeping
requirements proposed in this NPR. These QFC recordkeeping requirements
are organized into three categories as provided in Appendix A: (1)
Position level data (Table A1), (2) counterparty level data (Table A2),
and (3) certain contracts and lists of counterparty affiliates and
identifiers, affiliates of the institution that are counterparties to
QFC transactions, organizational charts involving the institution and
its affiliates, and supporting vendors (Section B). An institution in a
troubled condition is required to maintain the position level data and
counterparty data listed under Tables A1 and A2 in electronic files in
a format acceptable to the FDIC, and such institutions are required to
demonstrate the ability to produce this information immediately at the
close of processing of the institution's business day, for a period
provided in a written notification by the FDIC. The files required
under Section B are less quantitative and may be maintained in
electronic format, in written format, or in a combination of those two
formats. Nonetheless, the nature of this information requires that it
be updated and available upon request on a daily basis. For
institutions in a troubled condition with less than twenty open QFC
positions upon receipt of the written notification from the FDIC or the
institution's appropriate Federal banking agency under part 371 and
this Appendix, the data required in Tables A1 and A2 is not required to
be recorded in electronic form as otherwise would be required by this
part, so long as all required information is maintained and is capable
of being updated on a daily basis.
    The final rule and Appendix A are intended to facilitate the
ability of the receiver to gather relevant information on QFCs in order
to make business decisions within the short time frame between when a
failure occurs and when the FDIC as receiver must act under 12 U.S.C.
1821(e)(9) and (10). Also, the data fields and related information
required in Appendix A are important for the due diligence by
institutions of their QFC agreements in conjunction with their risk
management policies and procedures.
    For purposes of the final rule and Appendix A, ``position'' is
defined in the final rule to mean the rights and obligations of a
person or entity as party to an individual transaction. For example,
``position'' would include the rights and obligations of an institution
under a ``Transaction'' (as such term is defined in the 2002 Master
Agreement of ISDA), such as an interest rate swap.
    Table A1. No later than three business days after the institution's
receipt of the written notification from the FDIC under section
371.1(c) of this part, the institution must provide the FDIC with (i) a
directory of the electronic files that will be used by the institution
to maintain the position level data found in Table A1 and (ii) a point
of contact at the institution should the FDIC have follow-up questions
concerning this information. Table A1 requires data that must be
maintained regarding open QFC positions entered into by that
institution.\24\ For such data, the institution must produce at the
close of processing of the institution's business day a report that
aggregates the current market value and the amount of QFCs by each of
the delineated fields. The institution must produce the report within
60 days of a written notification by the FDIC for the period specified
in the notification. In addition, the FDIC also may require a certain
combination of recordkeeping fields from Table A1 where significant for
purposes of its evaluation of risks associated with the institution's
positions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ These positions include QFCs entered into by affiliates of
the insured institution that are covered by the master agreements to
which the institution is a party.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The following data fields are required in Table A1:
    1. Unique position identifier. This information includes CUSIP
identifiers or unique trade confirmation numbers, if available. This
information is needed in order to readily track and distinguish
positions.
    2. Portfolio location identifier. This information is used to
provide the location in which the position is booked by the institution
(e.g., the New York or London branch of the institution).
    3. Type of position. This information describes the products used,
sold or traded by an institution. It includes position types such as
interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, equity swaps, and foreign
exchange forwards, and securities or loan repurchase agreements.
    4. Purpose of the position. This information identifies the role of
the QFC in the institution's business strategy. For example, it would
identify whether the purpose of a position is for trading, or for
hedging other exposures such as mortgage loan servicing or certificates
of deposit.
    5. Termination date. This date indicates when the institution's
rights and obligations regarding the position are expected to end.
    6. Next call, put, or cancellation date. This information indicates
the next date when a call, put, or cancellation may occur with respect
to the position.
    7. Next payment date. This information includes payment dates for
potential upcoming obligations.
    8. Current market value of the position. This information covers
position values as of the date of the file. It is used to determine if
the institution is in- or out-of-the-money with the counterparty.
    9. Unique counterparty identifier. This information is used to
aggregate positions by counterparty.
    10. National or principal amount of the position. This information
is needed to assist in the FDIC's evaluation of the position. It
includes the notional amount where applicable.
    11. Documentation status of the position. This information
documents whether the position was affirmed, confirmed, or neither
affirmed nor confirmed. It is needed to determine the reliability of
booked positions and their legal status.
    Table A2. Table A2 requires data that must be maintained at the
counterparty \25\ level for all QFCs entered into by an institution.
For such data, the institution must demonstrate the ability to produce
immediately at the close of processing of the institution's business
day, for a period provided in a written notification by the FDIC, a
report that (i) itemizes, by each counterparty and its affiliates with
QFCs with the institution, the data required in each field delineated
in Table A2; and (ii) aggregates by field, for each counterparty and
its affiliates, the data required in each field. The following data
fields are required in Table A2:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ The use of the term ``counterparty'' in Appendix A
generally includes all entities (including all affiliates) that are
effectively treated as a single counterparty under a master
agreement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Unique counterparty identifier. This information would be used
by the FDIC to aggregate positions by counterparty.
    2. Current market value of all positions. This data must be
aggregated and to the extent permitted under all applicable agreements,
netted as of the date of the file. If one or more positions cannot be
netted against others, they would be maintained as separate entries.
    3. Current market value of all collateral posted by the
institution. This

[[Page 78169]]

information would include the current market value of all collateral
and the types of collateral, if any, that the institution has posted
against all positions with each counterparty.
    4. Current market value of all collateral posted by the
counterparty. This information includes the current market value of all
collateral and the types of collateral, if any, that the counterparty
has posted against all positions.
    5. Institution's collateral excess or deficiency. This information
is provided with respect to all the positions as determined under each
applicable agreement, such as master netting agreements and security
agreements. If all positions are not secured by the same collateral,
then separate entries should be maintained for each collateral excess
and/or deficiency. This information includes thresholds and haircuts
where applicable.
    6. Counterparty's collateral excess or deficiency. This information
is provided with respect to all the positions as determined under each
applicable agreement. If all positions are not secured by the same
collateral, then separate entries should be maintained for each
collateral excess and/or deficiency. This information would include
thresholds and haircuts where applicable.
    7. Institution's collateral excess or deficiency for all positions.
This information would be based on the aggregate market value of the
positions (after netting to the extent permitted under all applicable
agreements) and the aggregate market value of all collateral posted by
the institution against the positions, in whole or in part.
    B. Data files and contract information required under Section B:
Section B of Appendix A requires that other data files be maintained in
either written or electronic format for QFCs and upon a written request
by the FDIC, be produced immediately at the close of processing of the
institution's business day, for the period provided in that written
request. Each institution must maintain lists of: Counterparty
identifiers with the associated counterparty and contact information;
affiliates of the counterparties that are also counterparties to QFC
transactions; affiliates of the institution that are counterparties to
QFC transactions, specifically indicating which affiliates are direct
or indirect subsidiaries of the institution; and portfolio location
identifiers with the associated booking locations.
    For each QFC, the institution must maintain copies in a central
location or data base in the United States of certain agreements,
including active master netting agreements, and other QFC agreements
between the institution and its counterparties that govern the QFC;
active or ``open'' confirmations, if the position has been confirmed;
credit support documents; and assignment documents, if applicable. The
institution also must maintain a legal entity organizational chart; an
organizational chart of all personnel involved in QFC-related
activities at the institution, parent and affiliates; and a list of
vendors supporting the QFC-related activities.

VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) \26\ requires an agency
publishing a final rule to prepare and make available for public
comment a final regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the
impact of the final rule on small entities. Under regulations issued by
the Small Business Administration,\27\ a ``small entity'' includes a
bank holding company, commercial bank, or savings association with
assets of $165 million or less (collectively, small banking
organizations). The RFA provides that an agency is not required to
prepare and publish a regulatory flexibility analysis if the agency
certifies that the final rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ 5 U.S.C. 603(a).
    \27\ 13 CFR 121.201.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,\28\ the
FDIC certifies that the final rule would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The final
rule consists of requirements for institutions that have been
determined to be in a troubled condition, as defined in the rule. These
requirements include the maintenance of certain information regarding
the institution's QFCs that it would be able to produce on short notice
by the appropriate Federal banking agency or the FDIC. The rule would
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities for four reasons. First, QFCs are generally sophisticated
financial instruments that are usually used by larger financial
institutions to hedge assets, provide funding, or increase income.
Because of the nature of the capital markets in which QFCs are used,
smaller entities generally do not participate in such markets. Second,
the number of small entities affected is further limited due to the
proposed rule only being applicable to institutions that are determined
to be in a troubled condition under the definition in the rule. Third,
the impact on small entities that do use QFCs and are in a troubled
condition further is limited by the fact that the information requested
by the FDIC involves information that the institution already should
have accessible if it is operated in a safe and sound manner. Fourth,
the final rule minimizes recordkeeping burdens for community banks by
allowing institutions in a troubled condition with less than twenty
open QFC positions upon receipt of the written notification from the
FDIC under part 371 and the Appendix, to record and maintain data
required in Tables A1 and A2 in a written format instead of an
electronic format so long as the data are capable of being updated on a
daily basis.

VII. Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1995 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521, the FDIC may not conduct or
sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an
information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) control number. OMB has assigned the
following control numbers to the recordkeeping and reporting
requirements for QFCs: 3064-0163.
    In July 2008, the FDIC submitted the information collections
contained in the proposed rule to OMB for review and approval. For
purposes of the proposed rule, the FDIC estimated that the aggregate
annual burden of complying with this rule to be 9,600 hours. This
estimate assumed that 150 institutions would be subject to the
requirements of the proposed rule and that such institutions would
spend, on average, 24 hours annually complying with the proposed
reporting requirements and 40 hours annually complying with the
proposed records maintenance requirements. Factors considered in
developing the burden estimate include the existing and historical
average number of insured institutions with supervisory ratings of 3
(for institutions with total consolidated assets of ten billion dollars
or greater), 4, or 5; the volume of QFC activity in institutions that
presently have supervisory ratings of 3 (where the asset threshold for
an institution is met or exceeded), 4, or 5; the time necessary to
complete other types of regulatory reports; the frequency with which
the FDIC may require institutions to produce QFC information under this
proposed rule; and the time necessary to update and

[[Page 78170]]

maintain QFC and related information as required in the proposed rule.
    The FDIC's PRA estimate for the final rule is derived from the
product of the estimated number of institutions that would be subject
to the final rule and the estimated hours per respondent necessary to
meet the final rule's reporting and records maintenance requirements.
The estimated number of institutions subject to the requirements of the
final rule is 190, an increase of 40 since the publication of the
proposed rule.
    The combined reporting and record maintenance burdens related to
the final rule, consistent with estimates for the proposed rule, are
estimated at 64 hours per respondent annually. This estimate consists
of two components: A reporting component and a records systems
maintenance component. It is estimated that reports as described in
Table A and Section B of proposed Appendix A will require 2 hours on
average to complete. This estimate is based on a number of
considerations including the relatively small number of items
requested, the time necessary to complete other regulatory reports, and
the reported volume of QFC activity evident within the existing
population of institutions that would be subject to the rule. The time
necessary to produce such reports could be substantially more than 2
hours for larger institutions with greater QFC volumes.
    The FDIC may request the information required in Tables A1 and A2,
and section B of Appendix A of the final rule relatively frequently or
infrequently depending on such factors as the reported volume of an
institution's QFC exposures, the number of QFC positions held by an
institution (if known), and the near term failure prospects of an
institution. For example, the FDIC would be more likely to request the
information required to be maintained under this rule and Appendix A if
the institution has a sizeable volume of reported QFC exposures
(measured in carrying values or notational amounts as applicable)
relative to that institution's assets or regulatory capital than an
institution with a nominal volume of reported QFC exposures. Similarly,
the FDIC likely would require more frequent reporting for institutions
with low supervisory ratings. Based on the assumption that 12 reports
would be required within a given year for such institutions, the total
reporting component of the estimate would be 24 hours per respondent.
    It is further estimated that institutions subject to these
requirements will spend, on average, an estimated 10 hours per quarter,
or 40 hours annually updating and maintaining the records and
information required by section B of proposed Appendix A. Again, larger
institutions with greater QFC volumes would likely spend considerably
more time updating and maintaining records pertaining to QFC
activities. Combining the records maintenance and reporting component
estimates results in an estimated annual burden of 64 hours per
respondent.
    Section 371.1(c) of this final rule adds paperwork burden in the
form of an application for an extension of time to comply with the
requirements of the rule for institutions electing to make such a
request. The FDIC estimates that approximately 20 institutions will
file such applications and that the average time for preparing each
request will be approximately 30 minutes.
    In accordance with the requirements of the PRA, the FDIC has
submitted a request to OMB for approval of its revised burden
estimates. The revised burden for the collection of information is as
follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 190 (recordkeeping/reporting); 20
(application).
    Estimated Time per Response: 64 hours annually per respondent (24
hours--reporting; 40 hours--recordkeeping); 30 minutes (application).
    Estimated Total Annual Burden: 12,160 hours (recordkeeping/
reporting); 10 hours (application).
    Total Annual Burden: 12,170 hours.
    The FDIC has an ongoing interest in public comments on its burden
estimates. Any such comments should be sent to the Paperwork Reduction
Act Officer, FDIC Legal Division, 550 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC
20503. Written comments should address the accuracy of the burden
estimates and ways to minimize burden, including the use of automated
collection techniques or the use of other forms of information
technology, as well as other relevant aspects of the information
collection request.

VIII. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act

    The Office of Management and Budget has determined that the final
rule is not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of the relevant
sections of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act of 1996,
Public Law No. 110-28 (1996). As required by law, the FDIC will file
the appropriate reports with Congress and the General Accounting Office
so that the final rule may be reviewed.

    (b) Purpose. This part establishes recordkeeping requirements with
respect to qualified financial contracts for insured depository

    (c) Applicability. An insured depository institution shall comply
with this part within 60 days after written notification by the
institution's appropriate Federal banking agency or the FDIC that it is
in a troubled condition under Sec.  371.2(f). The FDIC may, at its
discretion, grant one or more extensions of time for compliance with
this part. No single extension shall be for a period of more than 30
days. An insured depository institution may request an extension of
time by submitting a written request to the FDIC at least 15 days prior
to the deadline for its compliance with the requirements of this part.
The written request for an extension must contain a statement of the
reasons why the institution cannot comply by the deadline for
compliance.


Sec.  371.2  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part:
    (a) Affiliate means any company that controls, is controlled by, or
is under common control with another company.

[[Page 78171]]

    (b) Appropriate Federal banking agency means the agency or agencies

    (c) Insured depository institution means any bank or savings
association, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813, the deposits of which are
insured by the FDIC.
    (d) Position means the rights and obligations of a person or entity

financial contracts that are defined in 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)(D) to
include securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts,
repurchase agreements, and swap agreements and any other contract
determined by the FDIC to be a QFC as defined in that section.
    (f) Troubled condition means for purposes of this part, any insured
depository institution that:
    (1) Has a composite rating, as determined by its appropriate
Federal banking agency in its most recent report of examination, of 3
(only for insured depository institutions with total consolidated
assets of ten billion dollars or greater), 4, or 5 under the Uniform
Financial Institution Rating System, or in the case of an insured
branch of a foreign bank, an equivalent rating;
    (2) Is subject to a proceeding initiated by the FDIC for
termination or suspension of deposit insurance;
    (3) Is subject to a cease-and-desist order or written agreement
issued by the appropriate Federal banking agency, as defined in 12
U.S.C. 1813(q), that requires action to improve the financial condition
of the insured depository institution or is subject to a proceeding
initiated by the appropriate Federal banking agency which contemplates
the issuance of an order that requires action to improve the financial
condition of the insured depository institution, unless otherwise
informed in writing by the appropriate Federal banking agency;
    (4) Is informed in writing by the insured depository institution's
appropriate Federal banking agency that it is in troubled condition for
purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1831i on the basis of the institution's most

information available to the institution's appropriate Federal banking
agency; or
    (5) Is determined by the appropriate Federal banking agency or the
FDIC in consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency to be
experiencing a significant deterioration of capital or significant
funding difficulties or liquidity stress, notwithstanding the composite
rating of the institution by its appropriate Federal banking agency in
its most recent report of examination.


Sec.  371.3  Form, availability and maintenance of records.

    (a) Form and availability. The records required to be maintained by
an insured depository institution for QFCs under this part--
    (1) Except for records that must be maintained through electronic
files under Appendix A of this part, may be maintained in any form,
including in an electronic file, provided that the records are updated
at least daily;
    (2) If the records are not maintained in written form, will be
capable of being reproduced or printed in written form; and
    (3) Will be made available upon written request by the FDIC
immediately at the close of processing of the institution's business
day, for a period provided in that written request.
    (b) Maintenance of records after the institution is no longer in a

that has been determined by the appropriate Federal banking agency to
be in a troubled condition ceases to exist as an insured depository
institution as a result of a merger or a similar transaction into an
insured depository institution that is not in a troubled condition
immediately following the acquisition, the obligation to maintain
records under this part on a daily basis will terminate when the
institution in a troubled condition ceases to exist as a separately
insured depository institution.


Sec.  371.4  Content of records.

    For each QFC for which an insured depository institution is a party

institution must maintain records as listed under Appendix A of this
part.


Sec.  371.5  Enforcement actions.

    Violating the terms or requirements of the recordkeeping
requirements set forth in this part constitutes a violation of a
regulation and subjects the participating entity to enforcement actions
under Section 8 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818).

Appendix A to Part 371--File Structure for Qualified Financial Contract
(QFC) Records

QFC Recordkeeping Requirements

A. Electronic Files To Be Maintained for QFCs

    Any insured depository institution that is subject to this part
(``institution'') must produce and maintain, in an electronic file
in a format acceptable to the FDIC, the position level data found in
Table A1 for all open positions in QFCs entered into by that
institution or for which the institution is subject. To fulfill this
requirement, not later than three business days after the
institution's receipt of the written notification from the FDIC
under Sec.  371.1(c) of this part, the institution must provide the
FDIC with (i) a directory of the electronic files that will be used
by the institution to maintain the position level data found in
Table A1 and (ii) a point of contact at the institution should the
FDIC have follow-up questions concerning this information. In
addition, for such data, the institution must produce at the close
of processing of the institution's business day a report in a format
acceptable to the FDIC that aggregates the current market value and
the amount of QFCs by each of the fields in Table A1. The
institution must produce the report within 60 days of a written
notification by the FDIC for the period specified in the
notification. Notwithstanding the above requirements, for
institutions in a troubled condition with less than twenty open QFC
positions upon receipt of the written notification from the FDIC or
the institution's appropriate Federal banking agency under part 371
and this Appendix, the data required in Table A1 are not required to
be recorded and maintained in electronic form as would otherwise be
required by this part, so long as all required information is
capable of being updated on a daily basis. If at any time after
receiving such notification an institution has twenty or more open
QFC positions at any point in time, it must within 60 days after
that first occurs, comply with all provisions of part 371.

for institutions in a troubled condition with less than twenty open
QFC positions upon receipt of the written notification from the FDIC
or the institution's appropriate Federal banking agency under part
371 and this Appendix, the data required in Table A2 is not required
to be recorded in electronic form as would otherwise be required by
this part, so long as all required information is maintained and is
