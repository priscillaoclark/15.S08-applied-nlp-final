Imposition of Import Restrictions on Categories of Archaeological 
and Ethnological Material From Morocco

AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland 
Security; Department of the Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This final rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) regulations to reflect the imposition of import restrictions on 
certain archaeological and ethnological material from the Kingdom of 
Morocco (Morocco). These restrictions are being imposed pursuant to an 
agreement between the Government of the United States and the 
Government of Morocco that has been entered into under the authority of 
the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act. The final rule 
amends the CBP regulations by adding Morocco to the list of countries 
which have a bilateral agreement with the United States that imposes 
cultural property import restrictions. The final rule also contains the 
Designated List that describes the types of archaeological and 
ethnological material to which the restrictions apply.

DATES: Effective on January 15, 2021.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background

    The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, Public Law 
97-446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. (hereinafter, ``the Cultural Property 
Implementation Act''), implements the 1970 United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on the Means 
of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer 
of Ownership of Cultural Property (823 U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)) 
(hereinafter, ``the Convention''). Pursuant to the Cultural Property 
Implementation Act, the Government of the United States entered into a 
bilateral agreement with the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco 
(Morocco) to impose import restrictions on certain archaeological and 
ethnological material from Morocco on January 14, 2021. This rule 
announces the imposition of import restrictions on certain 
archaeological and ethnological material from Morocco.

Determinations

    Under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1), the United States must make certain 
determinations before entering into an agreement to impose import 
restrictions under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). On April 30, 2020, the 
Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States 
Department of State, after consultation with and recommendation by the 
Cultural Property Advisory Committee, made the determinations required 
under the statute with respect to certain archaeological and 
ethnological material from Morocco that is described in the Designated 
List set forth below in this document. These determinations include the 
following: (1) That Morocco's cultural heritage is in jeopardy from 
pillage of certain types of archaeological material representing 
Morocco's cultural heritage ranging in date from approximately 1 
million B.C. to A.D. 1750 and certain types of ethnological material 
representing Morocco's cultural heritage from the Saadian and Alaouite 
dynasties ranging in date from approximately A.D. 1549 to 1912 (19 
U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(A)); (2) that the Moroccan government has taken 
measures consistent with the Convention to protect its cultural 
patrimony (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(B)); (3) that import restrictions 
imposed by the United States would be of substantial benefit in 
deterring a serious situation of pillage and remedies less drastic are 
not available (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(C)); and (4) that the application 
of import restrictions as set forth in this final rule is consistent 
with the general interests of the international community in the

[[Page 6562]]

interchange of cultural property among nations for scientific, 
cultural, and educational purposes (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(D)). The 
Assistant Secretary also found that the material described in the 
determinations meets the statutory definition of ``archaeological or 
ethnological material of the State Party'' (19 U.S.C. 2601(2)).

The Agreement

    On January 14, 2021, the Government of the United States and the 
Government of Morocco entered into a bilateral agreement, ``Memorandum 
of Understanding between the Government of the United States of America 
and the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco Concerning the Imposition 
of Import Restrictions on Categories of Archaeological and Ethnological 
Material of Morocco'' (hereinafter, ``the Agreement''), pursuant to the 
provisions of 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). The Agreement entered into force 
upon signature, and enables the promulgation of import restrictions on 
certain categories of archaeological material ranging in date from 
approximately 1 million B.C. to A.D. 1750, as well as certain 
categories of ethnological material from the Saadian and Alaouite 
dynasties ranging in date from approximately A.D. 1549 to 1912. A list 
of the categories of archaeological and ethnological material subject 
to the import restrictions is set forth later in this document.

Restrictions and Amendment to the Regulations

    In accordance with the Agreement, importation of material 
designated below is subject to the restrictions of 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 
Sec.  12.104g(a) of title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 
12.104g(a)) and will be restricted from entry into the United States 
unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and Sec.  12.104c of 
the CBP Regulations (19 CFR 12.104c) are met. CBP is amending Sec.  
12.104g(a) of the CBP Regulations (19 CFR 12.104g(a)) to indicate that 
these import restrictions have been imposed.
    Import restrictions listed at 19 CFR 12.104g(a) are effective for 
no more than five years beginning on the date on which the Agreement 
enters into force with respect to the United States. This period may be 
extended for additional periods of not more than five years if it is 
determined that the factors which justified the Agreement still pertain 
and no cause for suspension of the Agreement exists. The import 
restrictions will expire on January 14, 2026, unless extended.

Designated List of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Morocco

    The Agreement between the United States and Morocco includes the 
categories of objects described in the Designated List set forth below. 
Importation of material on this list is restricted unless the material 
is accompanied by documentation certifying that the material left 
Morocco legally and not in violation of the export laws of Morocco.
    The Designated List includes certain archaeological and 
ethnological material from the Kingdom of Morocco. The archaeological 
material in the Designated List includes, but is not limited to,

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public procedure 
(5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). For the same reason, a delayed effective date is 
not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply.

Executive Orders 12866 and 13771

    CBP has determined that this document is not a regulation or rule 
subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12866 or Executive Order 
13771 because it pertains to a foreign affairs function of the United 
States, as described above, and therefore is specifically exempted by 
section 3(d)(2) of Executive Order 12866 and section 4(a) of Executive 
Order 13771.
