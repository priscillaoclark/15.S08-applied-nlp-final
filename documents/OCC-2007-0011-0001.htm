Special Lending Limits for Residential Real Estate Loans, Small
Business Loans, and Small Farm Loans

AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury.

ACTION: Interim rule, request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is
amending Part 32 to permanently incorporate special lending limits for
1-4 family residential real estate loans, small business loans, and
small farm loans or extensions of credit. These special lending limits
have, since 2001, been available to certain eligible national banks
through a lending limits pilot program (pilot program). Under the pilot
program, an eligible national bank with a main office located in a
state that has a lending limit for residential real estate, small
business, or small farm loans that is higher than the current Federal
limit may apply to take part in the pilot program and make use of the
higher limit. The OCC has found that banks in the pilot program, and
loans made under the program, have operated in a safe and sound manner
since 2001. Accordingly, this interim rule amends Part 32 to make
permanent the special limits set forth in the pilot program. This
interim rule removes the expiration date for the pilot program and
makes one change to the special lending limits available under the
pilot program. The OCC also seeks comment on any other changes that
should be considered for the final rule. As in the past, only eligible
banks can use the special limits. Those banks already approved to
participate in the pilot program may continue to use the special
lending limits and need not submit a new application to do so.

9, 2007.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The percentage of capital and surplus that a bank may loan to any
one borrower is limited by 12 U.S.C. 84. Section 84 and the OCC's
implementing regulations, 12 CFR part 32, permit a national bank to
make loans in an amount up to 15 percent of its unimpaired capital and
surplus to a single borrower. A national bank may extend credit up to
an additional 10 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus to the same
borrower if the amount of the loan that exceeds the 15 percent limit is
secured by ``readily marketable collateral.'' \1\ Part 32 refers to
these lending limits as the ``combined general limit.'' The statute and
regulation also provide exceptions to, and exemptions from, the
combined general limit for various types of loans and extensions of
credit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 12 CFR 32.2(n) (defining ``readily marketable
collateral'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 84 authorizes the OCC to establish lending limits ``for
particular classes or categories of loans or extensions of credit''
that are different from those expressly provided by the statute's
terms.\2\ Effective September 10, 2001, the OCC added to Part 32 a new
Sec.  32.7, which established a three-year pilot program with special
lending limits for certain residential real estate loans and small
business loans or extensions of credit.\3\ The OCC extended the pilot
program in 2004 for an additional three years and, at the same time,
expanded the scope of the program to include certain small farm
loans.\4\ The aim of the program is to enable community national banks
to utilize a higher lending limit for certain residential real estate,
small business loans, and small farm loans, where the bank is located
in a state that allows state-chartered banks to apply a higher lending
limit, subject to the national bank's compliance with certain
conditions designed to ensure that lending under the higher limits is
consistent with safety and soundness.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 12 U.S.C. 84(d).
    \3\ 66 FR 31114 (June 11, 2001); 12 CFR 32.7.
    \4\ 69 FR 51355 (August 19, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For purposes of the special limits, a residential real estate loan
is a loan secured by a perfected first-lien security interest in 1-4
family real estate in an amount that does not exceed 80 percent of the
appraised value of the collateral at the time the loan is made. A small
business loan is a loan ``secured by nonfarm, nonresidential
properties'' or a ``commercial and industrial loan'' as those terms are
described in the current

[[Page 31442]]

version of the instructions for preparation of the Consolidated Report
of Condition and Income (Call Report), Schedule RC-C, part I, item nos.
1.e and 4 (FFIEC 031 and 041) (Loans and Lease Financing Receivables).
A ``small farm loan or extension of credit'' is a loan described in the
current version of the instructions for preparation of the Call Report,
Schedule RC-C, part I, item nos. 1.b and 3, as ``loans secured by
farmland'' and ``loans to finance agricultural production and other
loans to farmers.'' \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ For reporting purposes, the current version of the
instructions for Schedule RC-C part II of the Call Report, provides
that ``loans to small farms'' should be included on that schedule
only if the loans are for original amounts of $500,000 or less. This
$500,000 limit is not part of the regulation's definition of ``loans
to small farms.'' Therefore, it does not apply to or condition the
lending authority granted under the pilot program. Similarly, the
current version of the instructions for Schedule RC-C, part II of
the Call Report, provides that loans ``secured by nonfarm
residential property'' and ``commercial and industrial'' loans
should be included on that schedule only if they are loans for
original amounts of $1,000,000 or less. This $1,000,000 limit is not
part of the regulation's definition of loans ``secured by nonfarm
residential property'' and ``commercial and industrial'' loans.
Therefore, the $1,000,000 limit does not apply to or condition the
lending authority granted under the pilot program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The pilot program authorizes an eligible national bank to apply for
approval to make residential real estate, small business, and small
farm loans to a single borrower in addition to amounts that they may
already lend to that borrower under the existing combined general limit
in 12 CFR 32.3(a) and the limits for the particular categories of loans
enumerated in 12 CFR 32.3(b). A bank is eligible for the pilot program
only if it is well capitalized, as defined in 12 CFR 6.4(b)(1),\6\ and
has a composite rating of 1 or 2 under the Uniform Financial
Institutions Rating System (UFIRS), with at least a rating of 2 for
asset quality and for management. These criteria ensure that the
program is available only to banks in good financial condition with a
demonstrated record of making sound loans.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ A ``well capitalized'' bank under 12 CFR 6.4(b)(1) is one
that: (i) Has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 percent or
greater; (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 percent
or greater; (iii) has a leverage ratio of 5.0 percent or greater;
and (iv) is not subject to any written agreement, order or capital
directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the OCC
pursuant to section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI
Act), the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983 (12 U.S.C.
3907), or section 38 of the FDI Act, or any regulation thereunder,
to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital
measure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under the pilot program, an eligible national bank may make
residential loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in an
additional amount up to the lesser of 10 percent of its capital and
surplus, or the percent of its capital and surplus in excess of 15
percent that a state bank is permitted to lend under the state lending
limit that is available (in the state where the main office of the bank
is located) for residential loans, small business loans, and small farm
loans, or for unsecured loans.
    The pilot program contains a number of safeguards that apply to a
bank using its special lending limits. For example, the amount that a
bank may lend under the pilot program's special limits is subject to an
individual borrower cap and an aggregate borrower cap expressed as
percentages of the bank's capital and surplus. Under the individual
borrower cap, the total outstanding amount of a bank's loans to one
borrower under Sec. Sec.  32.3(a) and (b), together with loans made to
that borrower under the special limits authorized by Sec.  32.7, may
not exceed 25 percent of the bank's capital and surplus. The aggregate
cap provides that the total outstanding amount of loans made by a bank
to all of its borrowers under the special limits authorized by Sec.
32.7 may not exceed 100 percent of the bank's capital and surplus.
Finally, for each loan category covered by Sec.  32.7, a bank may not
lend more than $10 million to a single borrower under the special
limit.
    A bank must apply and obtain the OCC's approval before it may use
the special lending limits. The application includes: a certification
that the bank is well capitalized and has the requisite ratings;
citations to relevant state laws or regulations on lending limits; a
copy of a written resolution by a majority of the bank's board of
directors approving the use of the new lending authority; and a
description of how the board will exercise its continuing
responsibility to oversee the use of this lending authority.
    The OCC stated in the preamble to its 2001 and 2004 final rules
that, prior to the conclusion of the pilot program, the OCC would
evaluate the performance of the program and determine whether, and
under what circumstances, to extend the program or adopt it
permanently.

A. Supervisory Experience, 2001-2004

    As of the end of February 2004, 169 national banks headquartered in
23 states had received approval to participate in the program. At that
time, the OCC compared the performance of 129 banks that participated
in the program to that of comparable state-chartered banks and national
banks that did not participate in the program focusing on: (1) Loan
portfolio composition; (2) asset quality; (3) liquidity and capital;
and (4) differences in interest expense, non-interest expense and
profitability indicators between participating banks and their peers.
The OCC could not attribute any statistical differences in this
comparison group directly to participation in the pilot program and
concluded that the program had operated in a safe and sound manner
since its inception in 2001.\7\ On this basis, the OCC extended the
pilot program for three years, from 2004 until 2007, to collect
additional data and assess whether to integrate the special lending
limits provided by the program into Part 32 on a long-term or permanent
basis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 69 FR 21978, 21980 (April 23, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Supervisory Experience, 2004 to 2007

    As of February, 2007, the OCC had approved more than 288 national
banks to participate in the pilot program, representing nearly 15% of
national community banks. Banks that participate in the pilot program
are headquartered in twenty-four states in the U.S. The OCC gathered
supervisory data during the second phase of the pilot program to assess
the performance of participating banks. The data focused on: (1)
Adherence to the capital and surplus limits; (2) adherence to the $10
million cap on loans to one borrower; (3) whether loans made under the
pilot program were subject to supervisory criticism and, if so, the
amount of such loans and the category of supervisory criticism; (4)
whether loans made under the pilot program were past due and, if so,
the amount of such loans; (5) whether banks had adequate internal
controls and monitoring systems to provide oversight of loans made
under the pilot program; and (6) whether loans made under the pilot
program were in compliance with the resolutions issued by the bank's
board governing the program.
    The OCC's supervisory experience between 2004 and 2007 shows that
the expanded lending limits capacity has had a neutral impact on the
asset quality and overall safety and soundness of participating
institutions. This experience confirms our earlier observation that
authorization to use higher lending limits has been consistent with the
safety and soundness of participating institutions. National banks that
have made use of the program have indicated to the OCC that the special
lending limits allowed those banks to better serve their customers and
communities.

[[Page 31443]]

Description of the Interim Rule

    The interim rule incorporates the special lending limits currently
authorized by the pilot program into Part 32 with one change, makes
technical changes to remove references to the ``pilot program,'' and
eliminates the provision in Part 32 that limits the duration, to
September 10, 2007, of approvals given by the OCC to banks to lend
under the program's special limits. The interim rule removes the $10
million cap on loans to one borrower for loans in each loan category
covered by the interim rule. In view of the other limits and safeguards
in the interim rule, and the OCC's experience with the pilot program,
the OCC does not believe this restriction is necessary.
    Under the interim rule, an eligible national bank will continue to
be required to apply to, and receive approval by, the OCC before using
the special lending limits. A newly chartered national bank may apply
to use the special limits once it meets the criteria for an eligible
bank. The authority given by the OCC to national banks under the
special limits will not expire, but will continue to be subject to
discretionary termination by the OCC based on supervisory concerns
about credit quality, undue concentrations in the bank's portfolio of
residential real estate, small business, or small farm loans, or
concerns about the bank's overall credit risk management systems and
controls. The effect of this interim rule is to make the pilot program
permanent with the change noted above.
    The OCC also requests comment on the interim rule and on ways in
which the special lending limits could be expanded or enhanced,
consistent with safety and soundness.

Administrative Procedure Act/Effective Date

    The OCC finds that there is good cause to dispense with prior
notice and public comment on this interim rule and with the 30-day
delay of effective date generally prescribed by the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA). 5 U.S.C. 553. Under section 553(b) of the APA, the
OCC is not required to provide notice and an opportunity for public
comment on a rule if we find, for good cause, that notice and comment
are ``impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest.''
The OCC finds that notice and public comment before the interim rule
takes effect are unnecessary. The OCC has previously provided the
opportunity for comment on all aspects of the pilot program, in 2001
and 2004. The one change made to the program by the interim rule
relieves the restriction imposed by a cap that the OCC has concluded is
unnecessary based on its experience supervising institutions that have
participated in the program thus far. In addition, by issuing the rule
on an interim final basis, the OCC will avoid any unnecessary
disruption in the operation of the program and its special limits
during the pendancy of the comment period.
    Under section 553(d) of the APA, the OCC must generally provide a
30-day delayed effective date for final rules. The OCC may dispense
with the 30-day delayed effective date requirement ``for good cause
found and published with the rule.'' The OCC finds that there is good
cause to dispense with the effective date requirement because the
interim rule recognizes an exemption and will prevent unnecessary
disruption in the operation of the lending limits program in its
current form. In addition, the purpose of the delayed effective date
provision is to afford affected persons a reasonable time to comply
with rule changes. The interim rule imposes no further restrictions on
the substance of the existing lending limits pilot program. As such,
there is no need for banks to make adjustments to their current lending
under the program.

Solicitation of Comments on Use of Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Public Law 106-102,
section 722, 113 Stat. 1338, 1471 (Nov. 12, 1999), requires an agency
to use plain language in all proposed and final rules published. The
OCC believes that the interim rule is presented in a clear and
straightforward manner. We invite your comments on how to make this
interim rule easier to understand. For example:
    <bullet> Have we organized the material to suit your needs? If not,
how could this material be better organized?
    <bullet> Are the requirements in the regulation clearly stated? If
not, how could the regulation be more clearly stated?
    <bullet> Does the regulation contain language or jargon that is not
clear? If so, which language requires clarification?
    <bullet> Would a different format (grouping and order of sections,
use of headings, paragraphing) make the regulation easier to
understand? If so, what changes to the format would make the regulation
easier to understand?
    <bullet> What else could we do to make the regulation easier to
understand?

Solicitation of Comments on Impact on Community Banks

    The OCC adopted the pilot program following a review of our
regulations that focused on ways to change the regulations to respond
to community bank needs. 66 FR 31114, 31115 (June 11, 2001). The
purpose of the review was to explore ways in which our regulations
could be modified, consistent with safety and soundness, to reflect the
fact that community banks operate with more limited resources, and
often different risk profiles, than larger institutions. Our goal was
to identify alternative regulatory approaches to minimize the burden on
community banks and promote their competitiveness.
    The special lending limits in the interim rule are substantively
identical to those authorized by the pilot program. The OCC seeks
comments on how community banks assess the interim rule and on the
impact of the proposal on community banks' current resources and
available personnel with requisite expertise. The OCC also seeks
comments on whether the goals of the interim rule could be achieved,
for community banks, through an alternative approach.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) does not apply to a rulemaking
where a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required. 5 U.S.C.
603 and 604. As noted previously, the OCC has determined that it is
unnecessary to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking for this interim
final rule. Accordingly, the RFA's requirements relating to an initial
and final regulatory flexibility analysis do not apply.

Executive Order 12866

    The OCC has determined that this interim rule is not a significant
regulatory action under Executive Order 12866.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995

    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMA), Public Law 104-4,
109 Stat. 48, applies only when an agency is required to issue a
general notice of proposed rulemaking or a final rule for which the
agency published a general notice of proposed rulemaking, 2 U.S.C.
1532. As noted previously, the OCC has determined, for good cause, that
notice and comment is unnecessary for this interim rule. Accordingly,
the UMA does not require a budgetary impact analysis.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has reviewed and approved
the collection of information requirements contained in the pilot
program under

[[Page 31444]]

the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The
interim rule does not change the information collection previously
approved under control number 1557-0221 nor does it establish any new
information collections.
