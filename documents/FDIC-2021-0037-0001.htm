Background

    The final regulation that is the subject of this correction revised 
the FDIC's Securitization Safe Harbor Rule, which relates to the 
treatment of financial assets transferred in connection with a 
securitization transaction, in order to eliminate a requirement that 
the securitization documents require compliance with Regulation AB of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission in circumstances where 
Regulation AB by its terms would not apply to the issuance of 
obligations backed by such financial assets.

Need for Correction

    As published, the final regulation contains an error in the Federal 
Register instructions to amend the list of authorities cited for 12 CFR 
part 360.
