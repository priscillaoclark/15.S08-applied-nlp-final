swaps meeting certain conditions. The Commission is soliciting comments 
on all aspects of the proposed rule and alternative rule language and 
will carefully consider any comments received.

I. Introduction

    On July 21, 2010, the President signed the Dodd-Frank Act into 
law.\1\ The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted to, among other purposes, 
promote the financial stability of the United States by improving 
accountability and transparency in the financial system.\2\ Title VII 
of the Dodd-Frank Act provides the Commission and the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (``CFTC'') with the authority to regulate over-the-
counter (``OTC'') derivatives in light of the recent financial crisis, 
which demonstrated the need for enhanced regulation in the OTC 
derivatives market.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).
    \2\ See Public Law 111-203, Preamble.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Dodd-Frank Act provides that the CFTC will regulate ``swaps,'' 
the Commission will regulate ``security-based swaps,'' and the CFTC and 
the Commission will jointly regulate ``mixed swaps.'' \3\ The Dodd-
Frank Act amends

[[Page 79993]]

the Exchange Act \4\ to require, among other things, the following: (1) 
Transactions in security-based swaps must be cleared through a clearing 
agency if they are of a type that the Commission determines must be 
cleared, unless an exemption from mandatory clearing applies; \5\ (2) 
transactions in security-based swaps must be reported to a registered 
security-based swap data repository (``SDR'') or the Commission; \6\ 
and (3) if a security-based swap is subject to a clearing requirement, 
it must be traded on a registered exchange or a registered or exempt 
security-based swap execution facility, unless no facility makes such 
security-based swap available for trading.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Section 712(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the 
Commission and the CFTC, in consultation with the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System (``Federal Reserve''), shall jointly 
further define the terms ``swap,'' ``security-based swap,'' ``swap 
dealer,'' ``security-based swap dealer,'' ``major swap 
participant,'' ``major security-based swap participant,'' ``eligible 
contract participant,'' and ``security-based swap agreement.'' These 
terms are defined in Sections 721 and 761 of the Dodd-Frank Act and, 
with respect to the term ``eligible contract participant,'' in 
Section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''), 7 U.S.C. 
1a(18), as re-designated and amended by Section 721 of the Dodd-
Frank Act. See Exchange Act Release Nos. 62717 (Aug. 13, 2010), 75 
FR 51429 (Aug. 20, 2010) (File No. S7-16-10) (advance joint notice 
of proposed rulemaking regarding definitions contained in Title VII 
of the Dodd-Frank Act) (``Definitions Release''); 63452 (Dec. 7, 
2010) (``Definitions Proposing Release'').
    \4\ All references to the Exchange Act contained in this release 
refer to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the 
Dodd-Frank Act.
    \5\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C).
    \6\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(i) and sec. 766(a) (adding 
Exchange Act Sections 13(m)(1)(G) and 13A(A)(1), respectively).
    \7\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C). See also Public Law 111-203, sec. 761 (adding Exchange 
Act Section 3(a)(77) (defining the term ``security-based swap 
execution facility'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Dodd-Frank Act seeks to ensure that, wherever possible and 
appropriate, derivatives contracts formerly traded exclusively in the 
OTC market be cleared.\8\ One key way in which the Dodd-Frank Act 
promotes clearing of such contracts is by setting forth a process by 
which the Commission would determine whether a security-based swap is 
required to be cleared; if the Commission makes a determination that a 
security-based swap is required to be cleared, then parties may not 
engage in such security-based swap without submitting it for clearing 
unless an exception applies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See, e.g., Report of the Senate Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs regarding The Restoring American 
Financial Stability Act of 2010, S. Rep. No. 111-176 at 34 (stating 
that ``[s]ome parts of the OTC market may not be suitable for 
clearing and exchange trading due to individual business needs of 
certain users. Those users should retain the ability to engage in 
customized, uncleared contracts while bringing in as much of the OTC 
market under the centrally cleared and exchange-traded framework as 
possible.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Standards for mandatory clearing of security-based swaps are 
established by Exchange Act Section 3C(a)(1).\9\ The purpose of 
mandatory clearing of security-based swap products is to centralize 
individual counterparty risks through a clearing agency acting as a 
central counterparty that distributes risk among the clearing agency's 
participants. Exchange Act Section 3C(g) provides that a security-based 
swap otherwise subject to mandatory clearing is not required to be 
cleared if one party to the security-based swap is not a financial 
entity, is using security-based swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial 
risk, and notifies the Commission, in a manner set forth by the 
Commission, how it generally meets its financial obligations associated 
with entering into non-cleared security-based swaps (the ``end-user 
clearing exception'').\10\ Though beneficial for reasons such as those 
described above, mandatory clearing of security-based swaps may also 
alter the burdens on non-financial end-users of derivatives relative to 
bilateral transactions, and thereby possibly affect their risk 
management practices.\11\ Exchange Act Section 3C(g) is designed to 
permit non-financial end-users that meet the specified conditions to 
elect not to centrally clear security-based swaps and retain 
flexibility to use both cleared and non-cleared security-based swaps in 
their risk management activities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See Exchange Act Release No. 63557 (Dec. 15, 2010) 
(``Mandatory Clearing Release'').
    \10\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)). This clearing exception is elective. When trading 
with a security-based swap dealer and a major security-based swap 
participant, counterparties that are not swap dealers, security-
based swap dealers, major swap participants or major security-based 
swap participants have the right to forgo the end-user clearing 
exception and require clearing for a security-based swap that is 
subject to a Commission clearing mandate. These counterparties are 
granted a similar right when a security-based swap has been listed 
for clearing, but is not the subject of a Commission clearing 
mandate. See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(5)). The choice to require or forgo clearing is solely 
at the non-financial counterparty's discretion. See Public Law 111-
203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(2)).
    \11\ Burdens that may rest upon non-financial end-users arising 
from central clearing could include clearing fees and the 
requirement to post initial and variation margin. The net cost of 
these burdens to non-financial end-users is expected to vary. In 
particular, the final net cost to non-financial end-users would also 
need to account for the fees and charges of dealers and other 
counterparties to security-based swaps with non-financial end-users 
and for any bilateral margin or other collateral requirements 
established in connection with such transactions. As a result, it is 
possible that the costs for an end-user to engage in a centrally 
cleared transaction may be less than for comparable bilateral 
transactions in some circumstances. The Commission is requesting 
comments on the costs experienced by non-financial end-users in 
connection with both cleared and non-cleared security-based swaps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Dodd-Frank Act provides the Commission with authority to adopt 
rules governing the end-user clearing exception and to prescribe rules, 
issue interpretations or request information from persons claiming the 
end-user clearing exception necessary to prevent abuse of the 
exception.\12\ The Commission is also required to consider whether to 
exempt small banks, savings associations, farm credit system 
institutions and credit unions from the definition of ``financial 
entity'' contained in Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(3)(A). The Commission 
is proposing Rule 3Cg-1 under the Exchange Act to specify requirements 
for using the exception to mandatory clearing of security-based swaps 
established by Exchange Act Section 3C(g), together with proposed 
alternative language to provide an exemption for small banks, savings 
associations, farm credit system institutions and credit unions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 712(f). See also Pub. L. No. 
111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(6)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Description of Proposed Rule

A. Notification to the Commission

    In order to qualify for the end-user clearing exception, a non-
financial entity \13\ that uses security-based swaps to hedge or 
mitigate commercial risk must notify the Commission how it generally 
meets its financial obligations associated with non-cleared security-
based swaps.\14\ The Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to 
establish rules regarding such notification as well as to prescribe 
rules as may be necessary

[[Page 79994]]

to prevent abuse of the end-user clearing exception.\15\ The Commission 
is proposing Rule 3Cg-1 to require non-financial entities to notify the 
Commission each time the end-user clearing exception is used by 
delivering certain information to an SDR in the manner required by 
proposed Exchange Act Regulation SBSR.\16\ The Commission believes that 
receiving a notification for each transaction may provide for a more 
complete picture regarding how end-users meet their financial 
obligations based on the transactions in which they engage. The 
specified additional information would be delivered to the SDR by the 
reporting party defined in proposed Regulation SBSR (the ``Reporting 
Party'') \17\ together with other information regarding the security-
based swap separately required by proposed Regulation SBSR. Under the 
applicable requirements of proposed Regulation SBSR, the additional 
information required by proposed Rule 3Cg-1 would be delivered to the 
SDR in the same electronic format established by the SDR for purposes 
of proposed Regulation SBSR,\18\ promptly after the security-based swap 
transaction is executed, which for information of this kind would be no 
later than:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(1)(A) limits availability of the 
end-user clearing exception to circumstances when one of the 
counterparties to the security-based swap is not a financial entity. 
The term financial entity is defined in Section 3C(g)(3)(A) of the 
Exchange Act, and includes the following eight entities: (i) A swap 
dealer; (ii) a security-based swap dealer; (iii) a major swap 
participant; (iv) a major security-based swap participant; (v) a 
commodity pool as defined in section 1a(10) of the Commodity 
Exchange Act; (vi) a private fund as defined in section 202(a) of 
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80-b-2(a)); (vii) an 
employee benefit plan as defined in paragraphs (3) and (32) of 
section 3 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 
U.S.C. 1002); or (viii) a person predominantly engaged in activities 
that are in the business of banking or financial in nature, as 
defined in section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. 
Four of these terms, ``swap dealer'', ``major swap participant'', 
``security-based swap dealer'' and ``major security-based swap 
participant'' are themselves the subject of current proposed joint 
rulemaking by the Commission and the CFTC. Definitions Proposing 
Release, supra note 3.
    \14\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(1)(C)).
    \15\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 712(f) and sec. 763(a) (adding 
Exchange Act Sections 3C(g)(1)(C) and 3C(g)(6)).
    \16\ See Exchange Act Release No. 63346 (Nov. 18, 2010), 75 FR 
75208 (Dec. 2, 2010) (``Regulation SBSR Proposing Release''). 
Regulation SBSR contemplates that information may be delivered to 
the Commission directly in limited circumstances when an SDR is not 
available. When permitted by Regulation SBSR, such delivery would 
also meet the end-user clearing exception notice requirement. 
Persons wishing to comment on the requirements of proposed 
Regulation SBSR should submit comments pursuant to the Regulation 
SBSR Proposing Release.
    \17\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 901(a) under Regulation SBSR 
defines which of the parties to a security-based swap will be 
designated the Reporting Party for these purposes. See id.
    \18\ See id. (proposed Rules 901(h) and 907(a)(2) of proposed 
Regulation SBSR).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> 15 minutes after the time of execution for a security-
based swap that is executed and confirmed electronically;
    <bullet> 30 minutes after the time of execution for a security-
based swap that is confirmed electronically but not executed 
electronically; or
    <bullet> 24 hours after execution for a security-based swap that is 
not executed or confirmed electronically.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ See id. (proposed Rule 901(d)(2) of proposed Regulation 
SBSR).

The information delivered to the SDR pursuant to Rule 3Cg-1 would need 
to be accurate as of the date and time the information is delivered to 
the SDR.\20\ The Commission believes that this requirement should 
improve transaction efficiency by allowing notification to be made in a 
manner consistent with other transaction reporting requirements being 
developed pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. The timing requirements 
should also ensure the Commission has up to date information as of the 
time of submission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See id. (for each security-based swap transaction made in 
reliance on the end-user clearing exception, proposed Rule 
901(d)(1)(ix) under Regulation SBSR requires parties to a security-
based swap to indicate whether or not the end-user clearing 
exception is being invoked when reporting transaction information to 
an SDR as required by Exchange Act Section 13(m)(1)(F). The 
information required under proposed Exchange Act Rule 3Cg-1 is 
separate from these requirements but would be delivered to the SDR 
by the Reporting Party in the same manner as required by proposed 
Regulation SBSR).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Meeting Financial Obligations
    A non-financial entity invoking the end-user clearing exception 
must notify the Commission of ``how it generally meets its financial 
obligations associated with non-cleared security-based swaps'' 
(``Financial Obligation Notice'').\21\ Under existing market practices, 
counterparties to security-based swaps regularly use forms of 
collateral support both to create incentives for obligors to meet their 
financial obligations under the agreements and to provide themselves 
with access to some asset of value that can be sold or the value of 
which can be applied in the event of default.\22\ Though not required 
by Exchange Act Section 3C(g), such individualized credit arrangements 
between counterparties in bilateral security-based swap transactions 
can be important components of risk management consistent with the 
policy rationale of ensuring that the end-user clearing exception is 
reasonably available to non-financial entities hedging or mitigating 
commercial risks.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(1)(C)).
    \22\ See ISDA Collateral Steering Committee, Market Review of 
OTC Derivative Bilateral Collateralization Practices (2.0), (March 
1, 2010) (available at <a href="http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/Collateral-Market-Review.pdf">http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/Collateral-Market-Review.pdf</a>) (``ISDA Collateralization Practices'') 
(explaining credit risk, methods of risk mitigation and the context 
for collateralization as a risk reduction technique).
    \23\ See 156 Cong. Rec. S6192 (daily ed. July 22, 2010) (letter 
from Sen. Dodd and Sen. Lincoln to Rep. Frank and Rep. Peterson (the 
``Dodd-Lincoln Letter'')).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    However, a principal feature distinguishing cleared security-based 
swaps from non-cleared security-based swaps is that non-cleared 
security-based swaps do not provide a uniform method of mitigating such 
counterparty credit risk.\24\ Given this lack of uniformity, proposed 
Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5) would require a counterparty relying on the end-user 
clearing exception to provide certain information as part of its 
notification to the Commission regarding the methods used to mitigate 
credit risk in connection with non-cleared security-based swaps. If 
more than one method is used then information must be provided 
regarding each applicable method. Notification of all methods, as 
proposed in proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5), would provide the Commission 
with more complete information regarding the risk characteristics of 
non-cleared security-based swaps used by non-financial entities to 
hedge or mitigate commercial risk.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ See ISDA Collateralization Practices, supra note 22 
(describing methods of risk mitigation used in connection with OTC 
Derivatives and key legal foundations supporting collateralization).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5)(i) requires notification to the 
Commission regarding whether a credit support agreement is being used 
in connection with the non-cleared security-based swap. For these 
purposes, the term credit support agreement refers to any agreement, or 
annex, amendment or supplement to another agreement, which contemplates 
the periodic transfer of specified collateral to or from another party 
to support payment obligations associated with the security-based swap. 
Agreements of this kind are frequently used to mitigate the 
counterparty credit risk of security-based swaps and other derivatives 
that are not centrally cleared, but the use of such arrangements may be 
more or less common among certain types of counterparties and for 
certain types of security-based swaps.\25\ The proposed notification 
would provide the Commission with information regarding the extent to 
which credit support agreements are used by non-financial entities to 
support their financial obligations associated with non-cleared 
security-based swaps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ See ISDA Collateralization Practices, supra note 22. See 
also ISDA, ISDA Margin Survey 2010 (available at <a href="http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/ISDA-Margin-Survey-2010.pdf">http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/ISDA-Margin-Survey-2010.pdf</a>) (``ISDA 
Margin Survey 2010'') (describing collateralization levels for 
derivatives transactions by counterparty type, product type and 
types of collateral received).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5)(ii) requires notification to the 
Commission regarding whether the financial obligations associated with 
the non-cleared security-based swap are secured by collateral pledged 
under a written security arrangement not requiring the transfer of 
possession of collateral to either of the security-based swap 
counterparties. Examples of this type of

[[Page 79995]]

arrangement include, but are not limited to, (i) agreements granting 
security interests over property of the reporting person, whether or 
not such security interests are perfected by the filing of a mortgage, 
financing statements or similar documents, and (ii) agreements to 
transfer assets to collateral agents or escrow agents acting pursuant 
to instructions agreed by both parties to a security-based swap. While 
such arrangements may be somewhat less commonly used to mitigate credit 
risk associated with non-cleared security-based swaps, the Commission 
preliminarily believes these methods may have particular importance for 
certain categories of non-financial entities, such as enterprises with 
high levels of fixed assets relative to cash flows.\26\ Accordingly, 
the Commission preliminarily considers it appropriate to separately 
categorize this information in the data proposed to be collected.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ See ISDA Margin Survey 2010, supra note 25, at 9 (noting 
types of non-ISDA collateral agreements used and frequency of use).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5)(iii) requires notification to the 
Commission regarding whether the financial obligations associated with 
the non-cleared security-based swap are guaranteed by a person or 
entity other than the counterparty invoking the end-user clearing 
exception. The proposed notification would provide the Commission with 
information regarding the manner in which financial obligations are met 
by providing information regarding the use of guarantees by third 
parties (such as parent companies, affiliated parties or others) in 
meeting financial obligations associated with non-cleared security-
based swaps.\27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ See ISDA Collateralization Practices, supra note 22, at 20 
(identifying master cross-netting and cross-guarantee structures as 
common credit risk mitigation practices); see also ISDA 2002 Master 
Agreement, Multicurrency--Cross Border Schedule, Part 4(f) 
(contemplating bank letters of credit and third party guarantees as 
credit support documents).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5)(iv) requires notification to the 
Commission regarding whether the counterparty invoking the end-user 
clearing exception intends to meet its obligations associated with the 
security-based swap solely by utilizing available financial resources 
(i.e., its general creditworthiness).\28\ Financial resources that 
might be available to meet obligations associated with non-cleared 
security-based swaps may include any number of sources, including 
existing assets, investments and cash balances, cash flow from 
operations, short-term and long-term lines of credit and capital market 
sources of funding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ For a variety of reasons one or both of the counterparties 
to some non-cleared security-based swaps may choose not to mitigate 
credit risk and instead rely on the general creditworthiness of 
their opposite counterparty, given the circumstances and financial 
terms of the transaction. See, e.g., Office of the Comptroller of 
Currency, Risk Management of Financial Derivatives, Comptroller's 
Handbook, at 50 (Jan. 1997) (available at <a href="http://www.occ.gov/static/publications/handbook/deriv.pdf">http://www.occ.gov/static/publications/handbook/deriv.pdf</a>) (contemplating that evaluations of 
individual counterparty credit limits should aggregate limits for 
derivatives with credit limits established for other activities, 
including commercial lending).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5)(v) requires notification to the 
Commission regarding whether the counterparty invoking the end-user 
clearing exception intends to employ means other than those described 
in proposed Rules 3Cg-1(a)(5)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) to meet its 
financial obligations associated with a security-based swap. This item 
is intended to separately categorize all other methods that may be used 
in the markets today or that may develop in the future for meeting 
obligations associated with non-cleared security-based swaps relying on 
the end-user clearing exception to provide a clearer picture of the 
manner in which an end-user is meeting its financial obligations. The 
Commission anticipates many entities would meet their financial 
obligations through one of the specific methods listed in Rule 3Cg-
1(a)(5)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv). The information collected pursuant to 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5)(v), however, may allow the Commission to gain 
greater insight regarding the potential existence of other means for 
meeting financial obligations, as well as whether there is a 
significant number of transactions that would justify more granular 
rules concerning the manner in which end-users are meeting their 
financial obligations in the future with respect to whether and how 
end-users are using other credit risk mitigating methodologies to 
support meeting their financial obligations associated with non-cleared 
security-based swaps.
2. Preventing Abuse of the End-User Clearing Exception
    The remaining items of information required by proposed Rule 3Cg-1, 
specifically proposed Rules 3Cg-1(a)(1), (2), (3), (4) and (6), are 
designed to affirm compliance with particular requirements of Exchange 
Act Section 3C(g) or otherwise produce information necessary to aid the 
Commission in its efforts to prevent abuse of the end-user clearing 
exception as contemplated by Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(6).\29\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(6)). See also Public Law 111-203, sec. 764 (adding 
Exchange Act Section 15F of the Exchange Act creating new business 
conduct standards applicable to interactions of security-based swap 
dealers and major security-based swap participants with other 
counterparties).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(1) requires identifying which of the 
counterparties to the security-based swap is invoking the end-user 
clearing exception. At least one counterparty must be identified for 
each security-based swap that will rely on the end-user clearing 
exception. When both counterparties to a security-based swap are non-
financial entities and meet the other requirements of the end-user 
clearing exception, both parties may choose to use the exception and 
provide the required information to the SDR.
    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(2) requires information to be provided 
regarding the status of the counterparty invoking the end-user clearing 
exception as a non-financial entity under Section 3C(g)(3) of the 
Act.\30\ This information is being solicited because the exception to 
mandatory clearing of security-based swaps under Exchange Act Section 
3C(g) is only available to persons that are not financial entities, or 
are affiliates of non-financial entities satisfying the requirements of 
Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(3)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(3) requires information to be provided 
regarding whether the counterparty invoking the end-user clearing 
exception is an affiliate of another person qualifying for the 
exception under Exchange Act Section 3C(g), and satisfies the 
additional requirements of Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(4).\31\ Section 
3C(g)(4) of the Exchange Act contains a number of provisions specially 
designed for finance affiliates of persons qualifying for the end-user 
clearing exception, and among other things does not permit finance 
affiliates that are themselves swap dealers, security-based swap 
dealers, major swap participants, major security-based swap 
participants or certain other defined categories of entities to use the 
end-user clearing exception as an agent for another entity in any 
circumstances.\32\ Given these

[[Page 79996]]

additional features, the Commission preliminarily believes it is 
appropriate to separately categorize security-based swaps transacted by 
finance affiliates in particular in order to aid the Commission in its 
efforts to prevent abuse of the end-user clearing exception by being 
able to readily identify entities that qualify as financial entities 
and are participating in the use of the exception.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(4)).
    \32\ Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(4)(A) provides that affiliates 
of persons qualifying for the end-user clearing exception will also 
qualify for the end-user clearing exception if the affiliate (1) 
acts on behalf of the person and as agent, (2) uses the security-
based swap to hedge or mitigate commercial risk of that person or 
another affiliate of that person that is not a financial entity as 
defined in Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(3), and (3) is not itself one 
of seven entities defined in Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(4)(B). See 
Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act Section 
3C(g)(4)(A)). The seven entities are: (i) A swap dealer; (ii) a 
security-based swap dealer; (iii) a major swap participant; (iv) a 
major security-based swap participant; (v) an issuer that would be 
an investment company, as defined in section 3 of the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-3), but for paragraph (1) or (7) 
of subsection c of that Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)); (vi) a commodity 
pool; or (vii) a bank holding company with over $50,000,000,000 in 
consolidated assets. See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding 
Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(4)(B)). In addition, an affiliate, 
subsidiary, or wholly owned entity of a person that qualifies for an 
exception under Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(4)(A) and which is 
predominantly engaged in providing financing for the purchase or 
lease of merchandise or manufactured goods of the person shall be 
exempt from both the margin requirements described in Exchange Act 
Section 15F(e) and the clearing requirement in Exchange Act Section 
3C(a), provided that the security-based swaps in question are 
entered into to mitigate the risk of the financing activities. See 
Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act Section 
3C(g)(4)(C)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(4) requires information to be provided 
regarding whether the counterparty invoking the end-user clearing 
exception uses the security-based swap being reported to hedge or 
mitigate commercial risk. The exception to mandatory clearing of 
security-based swaps pursuant to Section 3C(g) of the Exchange Act is 
only available to persons that use security-based swaps to hedge or 
mitigate commercial risk. The Commission has proposed to adopt Exchange 
Act Rule 3a67-4 to define the meaning of hedging or mitigating 
commercial risk for these purposes.\33\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ See infra notes 49-51 and accompanying text.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(6) requires all counterparties invoking the 
end-user clearing exception to indicate whether they are an issuer of 
securities registered under Exchange Act Section 12 or required to file 
reports pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(d) (``SEC Filer'').\34\ 
Under Exchange Act Section 3C(i), the exception to mandatory clearing 
of security-based swaps pursuant to Exchange Act Section 3C(g) is 
available to SEC Filers only if an appropriate committee of the 
issuer's board of directors or governing body has reviewed and approved 
the issuer's decision to enter into security-based swaps that are 
subject to the exception.\35\ When the counterparty invoking the end-
user clearing exception is an SEC Filer, two additional items of 
information must be provided:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ For these purposes, a counterparty invoking the end-user 
clearing exception is considered by the Commission to be an issuer 
of securities registered under Exchange Act Section 12 or required 
to file reports pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(d) if it is 
controlled by a person that is an issuer of securities registered 
under Exchange Act Section 12 or required to file reports pursuant 
to Exchange Act Section 15(d). See Rule 1-02(x) of Regulation S-X, 
17 CFR 210.1-02(x) (defining subsidiary for purposes of the 
financial statements required to be filed as part of registration 
statements under Section 12, and annual and other reports under 
Exchange Act Sections 13 and 15(d)).
    \35\ See Public Law 111-203, Sec.  763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(i). For these purposes, the Commission considers a 
committee to be appropriate if it is specifically authorized to 
review and approve the issuer's decisions to enter into security-
based swaps).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(6)(i) requires an SEC Filer 
invoking the end-user clearing exception to specify its SEC Central 
Index Key number. Collection of this information will allow the 
Commission to cross reference materials filed with the relevant SDR 
with information in periodic reports and other materials filed by the 
SEC Filer with the Commission.\36\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ Exchange Act Section 3C(i) contemplates board review and 
approval of the decision to enter into the swap that is subject to 
the exemption. See Item 305 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.305.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(6)(ii) requires confirmation that 
an appropriately authorized committee of the board of directors or 
equivalent governing body of the SEC Filer invoking the clearing 
exception has reviewed and approved the decision to enter the security-
based swap subject to the end-user clearing exception.\37\ The 
Commission preliminarily believes collection of this information is 
appropriate to promote compliance with the requirements of the end-user 
clearing exception.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \37\ For example, a board resolution or an amendment to a board 
committee's charter could expressly authorize such committee to 
review and approve decisions of the reporting person not to clear 
the security-based swap being reported. In turn, such board 
committee also could adopt policies and procedures regarding the 
review and approval required by Exchange Act Section 3C(i), which 
may include periodic consideration of the relative costs, risk 
management characteristics and other features of cleared and non-
cleared security-based swaps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Request for Comment

    The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1. Additionally, the Commission requests comments on 
the following specific issues:
    <bullet> Is it sufficiently clear what information the Commission 
is requiring to be reported under proposed Rule 3Cg-1? If not, why not? 
Are there clarifications or instructions the Commission could adopt 
that would be useful for parties seeking to invoke the end-user 
clearing exception? If so, what are they and what would be the benefits 
of adopting them?
    <bullet> Would it be difficult or prohibitively expensive for 
counterparties to report the information required under the proposed 
Rule 3Cg-1? If so, why?
    <bullet> Should the Commission require more or less frequent 
notifications to the Commission than are currently contemplated by 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1? What other types of notifications should the 
Commission consider and what would be the potential frequency 
associated with such notifications? Are the requirements that the 
information provided under the proposal be accurate as of the date and 
time the information is provided to the SDR appropriate? Should the 
Commission consider any other time frame for accuracy of information? 
If so, what time frame should the Commission consider and what would be 
the advantages or disadvantages of such time frame?
    <bullet> Should the Commission consider collecting more or less 
information than it has proposed to collect in connection with the 
Financial Obligation Notice? Is other information needed to achieve the 
purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to how an end-user meets 
its financial obligations or in order to prevent evasion of the end-
user clearing exception? For example, is it necessary or appropriate 
for the Commission to collect:
    [cir] Additional information from that proposed regarding the 
credit support agreement and the collateral practices under the 
agreement, such as the level of margin collateral outstanding (e.g., 
less than or equal to a specified dollar amount, or greater than a 
series of progressively higher dollar amounts) or the frequency of 
portfolio reconciliation?
    [cir] Additional information from that proposed regarding the types 
of collateral provided (e.g., cash, government securities, other 
securities, other collateral) by an end-user and the effect of the 
liquidity of such collateral on the ability of the end-user to meet its 
financial obligations?
    [cir] Additional information from that proposed regarding specific 
terms of the credit support agreement, such as whether the collateral 
requirements are unilateral or bilateral provisions and whether there 
are contractual terms triggered by changes in the credit rating or 
other financial circumstances of one or both of the counterparties?
    [cir] Additional information from that proposed about the 
guarantor, such as whether or not the guarantor is a parent

[[Page 79997]]

or affiliate of the person invoking the end-user clearing exception?
    [cir] Additional information from that proposed regarding the 
assets pledged, such as the type of security interest or the type of 
property being used as collateral?
    [cir] Additional information from that proposed regarding the 
segregation arrangements, such as the identity of the collateral agent 
or other third party involved in the arrangement, and information 
regarding whether the arrangement involves a custodial, tri-party or 
different type of relationship?
    [cir] Additional information from that proposed regarding the 
adequacy of other means being used, or the adequacy of the financial 
resources available, to meet the financial obligations associated with 
the non-cleared security-based swap?
    [cir] Additional information from that proposed regarding the 
review and approval by the appropriate committee of the SEC Filer's 
board or governing body of the issuer's decision to enter into the 
security-based swap subject to the end-user clearing exception, such as 
information provided to the committee and/or a summary of the policies 
and procedures used by the committee in practice?
    <bullet> Are each of the terms used in Exchange Act Section 
3C(g)(4) sufficiently clear to permit compliance with proposed Rule 
3Cg-1 by affiliates invoking the end-user clearing exception? Should 
the Commission adopt more specific requirements to implement the 
provisions of Exchange Act 3C(g)(4)? Should the Commission provide 
further guidance on terms used in Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(4), such 
as the meaning of the term ``predominantly engaged''? If so, what 
specific rules or guidance should the Commission consider and what 
would be the benefits of adopting them?
    <bullet> Are the requirements of Exchange Act Section 3C(i) 
sufficiently clear to permit compliance with proposed Rule 3Cg-1 by 
parties invoking the end-user clearing exception? Should the Commission 
adopt more specific requirements to implement the provisions of 
Exchange Act 3C(i)? For example, should the Commission adopt provisions 
to specify the membership or other characteristics of the board 
committee, such as that a majority of the committee, or the entire 
committee, consist of independent directors? Should the Commission 
adopt provisions to clarify the steps that should be taken by board 
committees reviewing and approving an SEC Filer's decision to enter 
into security-based swaps subject to the end-user clearing exception? 
If so, what specific rules should the Commission consider and what 
would be the benefits or disadvantages of adopting them? Should the 
review and approval contemplated by Exchange Act Section 3C(i) include 
a review and approval of the SEC Filer's decisions by a board committee 
(1) Composed of a majority of independent directors, (2) that has 
adopted procedures pursuant to which security-based swap transactions 
that are subject to the end-user clearing exception may be entered into 
by the company, which are reasonably designed to facilitate a risk 
management policy that has been approved by the board or an appropriate 
committee, (3) that makes and approves such changes to the policy as 
the committee deems necessary, and (4) determines no less frequently 
than quarterly that all security-based swap transactions entered into 
during the preceding quarter subject to the end-user clearing exception 
were effected in compliance with such procedures? \38\ Are there other 
Commission rules concerning board approvals that may be useful models 
for the review and approval contemplated by Exchange Act Section 3C(i)?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ Cf., 17 CFR 270.17a-7(e) (Rule 17a-7(e) under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Is the meaning of the term ``issuer of securities'' as 
used in Exchange Act Section 3C(i) sufficiently clear? Is there a 
better alternative that the Commission should consider?
    <bullet> Should the Commission consider requiring parties invoking 
the end-user clearing exception to report additional types of 
information, to limit the possibility for the exception to be abused or 
for other reasons? If so, what other information should be reported and 
what would be the benefit of requiring such information to be reported? 
What categories of information, if any, should not be required to be 
reported and why?
    <bullet> Will some types of security-based swaps be more 
susceptible to abuse than others? For example:
    [cir] Are persons more or less likely to abuse the end-user 
clearing exception in connection with credit default swaps or equity 
swaps or when the underlying reference credit or security has certain 
characteristics?
    [cir] Are large or small companies or other identifiable sub-
categories of counterparties to security-based swaps more or less 
likely to abuse the end-user clearing exception than other persons?
    [cir] Are there certain security-based swap products or 
counterparties that the Commission should monitor for abuse more 
closely than others?

If so, why?

    <bullet> Are there different considerations for small companies or 
other identifiable categories of persons who may wish to invoke the 
end-user clearing exception? If so, what are they and how should the 
Commission take these considerations into account?
    <bullet> Should the Commission consider requiring that a narrative 
statement be provided when an end-user employs means other than those 
described in proposed Rules 3Cg-1(a)(5)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) to 
meet its financial obligations?
3. Form of Notice to the Commission
    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) provides that a counterparty to a security-
based swap that invokes the end-user clearing exception shall satisfy 
the notice requirements of Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(1)(C) by 
delivering or causing to be delivered the additional information 
specified in proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) to a registered SDR or the 
Commission in the form and manner required for delivery of the 
information separately specified under proposed Rule 901(d) of 
Regulation SBSR.\39\ Delivery of such information would also allow the 
information submitted pursuant to proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) by the 
counterparty invoking the end-user clearing exception to be made 
available to the public by the SDR, to the extent required by proposed 
Regulation SBSR.\40\ Under this approach, rather

[[Page 79998]]

than collecting information through a separate process established by 
the Commission for these purposes, the information delivered in 
compliance with the requirements of proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) and proposed 
Regulation SBSR would serve as the official notice of a security-based 
swap transaction made in reliance on the end-user clearing exception.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \39\ See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, supra note 16. For 
each security-based swap transaction made in reliance on the end-
user clearing exception, proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(ix) under 
Regulation SBSR requires parties to a security-based swap to 
indicate whether or not the end-user clearing exception is being 
invoked when reporting transaction information to an SDR as required 
by Exchange Act Section 13(m)(1)(F). Proposed Exchange Act Rule 
901(a) under Regulation SBSR defines which of the parties to a 
security-based swap will be designated the Reporting Party for these 
purposes. The information required under proposed Exchange Act Rule 
3Cg-1 would be in addition to these requirements but would be 
delivered to the SDR by the Reporting Party in the same manner as 
required by proposed Regulation SBSR. Regulation SBSR contemplates 
that information may be delivered to the Commission directly in 
limited circumstances when an SDR is not available. When permitted 
by Regulation SBSR, such delivery would also meet the end-user 
clearing exception notice requirement.
    \40\ See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, at Section V., supra 
note 16, discussing public dissemination of security-based swap 
transaction information generally, including Exchange Act Section 
13(m)(1)(B) (authorizing the Commission to make security-based swap 
transaction data available to the public to enhance price discovery) 
and Exchange Act Section 13(m)(1)(E)(iv) (requiring the Commission 
to consider whether public disclosure of security-based swap 
transaction data will materially reduce market liquidity). The 
Commission preliminarily believes information collected pursuant to 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1 would not be required to be publicly 
disseminated, but is requesting comments on this point. See infra 
note 47 and accompanying text.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Dodd-Frank Act requires all transactions in security-based 
swaps (whether cleared or non-cleared) to be reported to a registered 
SDR or the Commission.\41\ As centralized recordkeeping facilities of 
OTC derivatives transactions, SDRs are intended to play a critical role 
in enhancing transparency in the security-based swap markets. SDRs will 
enhance transparency by having complete records of security-based swap 
transactions, maintaining the integrity of those records, and providing 
effective access to those records to relevant authorities and the 
public in line with their respective information needs.\42\ The 
Commission recently proposed a series of new rules relating to the SDR 
registration process, duties, and core principles to ensure that SDRs 
operate in the manner contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act.\43\ The 
Commission also recently proposed Regulation SBSR to establish the 
standards that would apply when information is submitted to an SDR.\44\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \41\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(i) and sec. 766(a) (adding 
Exchange Act Sections 13(m)(1)(G) and 13A(A)(1), respectively).
    \42\ In the case of non-cleared security-based swaps, each SDR 
is required to confirm with both parties to the security-based swap 
the accuracy of the data submitted to the SDR pursuant to Exchange 
Act Section 13(n)(5)(B), and both the parties to the security-based 
swap and the SDR have duties to correct errors in the data that may 
be identified under proposed Rules 905(a) (parties to the security-
based swap) and 905(b) (SDRs) of Regulation SBSR. See Public Law 
111-203, sec. 763(i) (adding Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)(B); 
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, supra note 16. SDRs are required 
by Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5) (15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)) to have 
policies and procedures reasonably designed to protect the privacy 
of all transaction information received by the SDR, and the 
Commission recently proposed Rule 13n-9 to implement this 
requirement. See Exchange Act Release No. 63347 (Nov. 19, 2010), 75 
FR 77306 (Dec. 10, 2010) (``Regulation SDR Release''). Exchange Act 
Section 13A(c)) requires each party to a non-cleared security-based 
swap to maintain records of the security-based swaps held by such 
party in the form required by the Commission, and Exchange Act 
Section 13A(d) mandates that these records must be in a form not 
less comprehensive than required to be collected by SDRs. See Public 
Law 111-203, sec. 766(a) (adding Exchange Act Sections 13A(c)-(d)) 
These records are available for inspection by the Commission and 
other specified authorities pursuant to Exchange Act Section 
13A(c)(2) (Public Law 111-203, sec. 766(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 13A(c)(2))).
    \43\ See Regulation SDR Release, supra note 42.
    \44\ See id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission preliminarily believes collecting notice information 
for the end-user clearing exception through SDRs will support the 
development of straight through trade processing, help to reduce the 
administrative burdens of the notice requirement and assure the 
accuracy of the information collected.\45\ Using the centralized 
facilities of SDRs should also make it easier for the Commission to 
analyze how the end-user clearing exception is being used, monitor for 
potentially abusive practices, and take timely action to address 
abusive practices if they were to develop.\46\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \45\ See id. Exchange Act Sections 13(n) and 13A require parties 
to report transaction information to SDRs, confirm its accuracy and 
correct inaccuracies. See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(i) (adding 
Exchange Act Section 13(n)); Public Law 111-203, sec. 766(a) (adding 
Exchange Act Section 13A). The Commission preliminarily believes 
these requirements create sufficient assurance to consider the 
transaction records collected by SDRs reliable for use in connection 
with regulatory decisions, and therefore the Commission 
preliminarily believes the records should also be considered 
reliable for purposes of the notice requirement under Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g). Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)).
    \46\ The proposed notification method is supported by the 
recordkeeping requirements under Exchange Act Section 13A, which 
will permit the Commission to review transaction information and 
take such action as may be necessary to prevent abuses of the end-
user clearing exception. See Public Law 111-203, sec. 766(a) (adding 
Exchange Act Section 13A). Such Commission action would be taken in 
a manner consistent with our review practices for other transaction 
information submitted to SDRs, rather than through a separate 
process developed for these purposes, thereby helping to maintain 
consistency of regulatory action in comparable areas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under proposed Regulation SBSR, and in particular proposed Rule 
901(d), the information required to be reported to an SDR includes, if 
the security-based swap is not cleared, ``whether the exception in 
Section 3C(g) of the Exchange Act was invoked.'' This information would 
then be included in the transaction report disseminated to the public 
under proposed Rule 902. Pursuant to proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a), however, 
the information required to be reported to an SDR would include more 
detailed information than simply whether Section 3C(g) was invoked--for 
example, under Rule 3Cg-1(a) the reportable information would include 
the identity of the counterparty relying on the clearing exception, and 
information regarding how that counterparty expects to meet its 
financial obligations. The Commission preliminarily believes that this 
additional information would either fall under the exception to public 
dissemination contained in proposed Rule 902(c)(2),\47\ or otherwise 
should be excluded from the publicly-disseminated transaction report. 
Thus, the only information collected pursuant to Rule 3Cg-1 that would 
be disseminated publicly is ``whether the exception to Section 3C(g) of 
the Exchange Act was invoked.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \47\ Proposed Rule 902(c)(2) of Regulation SBSR would prohibit 
disclosure of any information disclosing the business transactions 
and market positions of any person with respect to a security-based 
swap that is not cleared. See supra note 16 (citing Regulation SBSR 
Proposing Release).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Request for Comment

    The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1. Additionally, the Commission requests comments on 
the following specific issues:
    <bullet> Is it appropriate for the Commission to require 
notification regarding use of the end-user clearing exception to be 
made through SDRs? Should notifying the Commission necessarily involve 
direct conveyance of the information to the Commission rather than 
delivery through an SDR? What are the advantages or disadvantages of 
the Commission's proposal?
    <bullet> Does collecting Financial Obligation Notice information 
through SDRs interfere with the ability of non-financial entities to 
use the end-user clearing exception in any way? Are SDRs reliable 
enough to be used for these purposes? Are the services provided by SDRs 
reasonably available to non-financial entities?
    <bullet> Is Financial Obligation Notice information different from 
other information proposed to be collected by SDRs in some respect that 
makes use of SDRs for these purposes inappropriate? If so, how is the 
notice information different and why is it inappropriate to use SDRs to 
collect the information?
    <bullet> Would it be preferable to require notice of use of the 
end-user clearing exception to be given through the Commission's EDGAR 
system on a newly developed EDGAR form? \48\ What would be the 
advantages or disadvantages of using the EDGAR system? For example:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \48\ See EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume I: ``General Information'' 
Version 8 (Sept. 2009), incorporated by reference into the Code of 
Federal Regulations (Release Nos. 33-9058, 34-60390, 39-2466, IC-
28838, July 28, 2009); EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume II: ``EDGAR 
Filing,'' Version 15 (Aug. 2010), incorporated by reference into the 
Code of Federal Regulations (Release Nos. 33-9140; 34-62873; 39-
2471; IC-29413, Sept. 9, 2010).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [cir] Do parties intending to invoke the end-user clearing 
exception anticipate any benefits or burdens of filing an EDGAR form 
electronically that should be considered?

[[Page 79999]]

    [cir] Is the EDGAR system likely to be familiar to all entities 
invoking the end-user clearing exception? Will small companies or other 
identifiable categories of persons face different burdens or advantages 
than others when using the EDGAR system?
    [cir] Should the Commission require persons invoking the end-user 
clearing exception to submit notice to the Commission on an EDGAR form 
in addition to the information collected through SDRs? Would collecting 
information in both ways significantly aid the Commission's efforts to 
prevent abuse of the end-user clearing exception or have other benefits 
that should be considered by the Commission? Would doing so create 
significant additional burdens for persons invoking the end-user 
clearing exception?
    <bullet> Other than the alternative of using the Commission's EDGAR 
system, are there other methods that the Commission should consider for 
receiving notification regarding the use of the end-user clearing 
exception? For example, could the information submitted to an SDR also 
be dually submitted to Commission in some form? If so, what are the 
possible alternatives and what advantages or disadvantages would they 
have?
    <bullet> Do the Exchange Act and the associated rules and proposed 
rules regulating SDRs and parties to security-based swaps create 
sufficient assurance that notice information collected through SDRs 
will be accurate? Are there additional protections the Commission 
should establish to create greater assurance that the notice 
information collected will be accurate? If so, what are they and how 
will they improve the information collection process?
    <bullet> Would the person reporting information to the SDR be in a 
position to know, in all cases, the information the Commission is 
requiring to be reported under proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)? If not, why not? 
Are representations and warranties and similar established market 
practices associated with documenting security-based swap transactions 
adequate to ensure the person reporting information to the SDR can 
obtain the information required to be reported under proposed Rule 3Cg-
1?
    <bullet> Should the Commission consider more or less frequent 
reporting of the information required by Rule 3Cg-1(a)? How frequently 
will the information required to be reported be expected to change? 
Would alternatives to proposed Rule 3Cg-1 such as the collection of 
periodic reports or updates of general notifications to the Commission 
be sufficient to achieve the purposes of Exchange Act Section 3C(g)? If 
so, what are the possible alternatives and what advantages or 
disadvantages would they have?
    <bullet> How long would it be expected to take for the person 
reporting information to the SDR to gather the information required 
under proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)? Will the time needed to gather the 
required information disrupt the transaction process for security-based 
swaps to any material extent?
    <bullet> Should the Commission require persons invoking the end-
user clearing exception to follow additional compliance practices in 
some circumstances? For example:
    [cir] Should the Commission require persons invoking the end-user 
clearing exception swap to create additional records of the means being 
used to mitigate the credit risk of the security-based swap as 
contemplated by proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5) and maintain such record in 
the manner required by Exchange Act Section 13A(d)?
    [cir] Should the Commission require persons invoking the end-user 
clearing exception to file materials referred to in proposed Rule 3Cg-
1(a)(5) with the Commission? Why or why not?
    [cir] Should the Commission require persons invoking the end-user 
clearing exception to establish any other additional compliance 
practices? If not, why not? If so, what should those practices be and 
what would be the advantages and disadvantages of adopting such a 
requirement?
    <bullet> Will collecting notice information together with other 
transaction information have the advantages expected by the Commission? 
For example, will analyzing information regarding use of the end-user 
clearing exception by product type and other transaction 
characteristics help to promote market efficiency or inform future 
Commission rulemaking? Are there other advantages or disadvantages 
related to collecting notice information through SDRs that the 
Commission should consider? If so, what are they?
    <bullet> Does collecting notice information regarding use of the 
end-user clearing exception through SDRs create significantly greater 
burdens or advantages for some parties to security-based swaps compared 
to others? For example, will parties who frequently transact security-
based swaps face higher or lower burdens or advantages compared to 
parties that enter into security-based swap transactions less 
frequently? Will parties who enter into both cleared and non-cleared 
security-based swaps face different burdens or advantages in comparison 
to parties who enter into only cleared security-based swaps or only 
non-cleared security-based swaps? Will small companies face different 
burdens than large companies? If so, what steps should the Commission 
consider taking to account for these differences? Given that certain 
efficiencies may arise from conducting frequent transactions in 
security-based swaps, are the additional burdens that may be faced by 
small companies or non-financial entities that enter into security-
based swaps infrequently unique to the proposed rule or do they 
principally reflect the nature of the security-based swaps market and 
the nature of the transacting party? Are there benefits from collecting 
notice information that should also be considered?
    <bullet> Should any or all of the information required to be 
reported to an SDR pursuant to proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) be publicly 
disseminated? Should public dissemination be limited only to the fact 
that Exchange Act Section 3C(g) was invoked? Are there any changes to 
the proposed rules the Commission should consider regarding public 
dissemination? If publicly disclosed, how would market participants, 
academics and other members of the public expect to use such 
information and what are the potential benefits or costs of such uses? 
Would additional information be useful? What information, if any, 
included in proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) would raise concerns for end-users 
if made public after the end-user elected to use the exception? How 
would the public interest be better served by keeping information 
relating to the end-user clearing exception in or out of the public 
domain?
    <bullet> If restrictions on public dissemination of the information 
are in place, should the Commission consider permitting such 
dissemination after the lapse of a certain period of time? If so, 
should all or only a subset of the information be disseminated? What 
would be an appropriate time period for a delay in dissemination? How 
would the analysis of whether the public interest would be better 
served by keeping information relating to the end-user clearing 
exception in or out of the public domain change based on whether there 
is a delay in such dissemination?
    <bullet> Should information regarding whether the end-user clearing 
exception was invoked that is collected pursuant to proposed Rule 3Cg-
1(a) be made available to the public through the SDR or through new 
processes established by the Commission? What would be the advantages 
and disadvantages of either approach?

B. Hedging or Mitigating Commercial Risk

    To apply the end-user clearing exception, Exchange Act Section 
3C(g)(1)(B) requires a non-financial entity to determine whether it 
uses security-based swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk.\49\ The 
phrase ``hedging or mitigating commercial risk'' is itself the subject 
of current joint rulemaking by the Commission and the CFTC. The 
Commission and the CFTC recently proposed a definition of ``hedging or 
mitigating commercial risk'' under proposed Exchange Act Rule 3a67-4 
that the Commission preliminarily believes should also govern the 
meaning of ``hedging or mitigating commercial risk'' for purposes of 
Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(1)(B).\50\ The Commission preliminarily 
believes this approach should ensure consistency of interpretation 
across the Exchange Act provisions for which this concept is relevant 
and provide assurance of fair and equivalent treatment for similarly 
situated parties in a wide variety of circumstances.\51\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \49\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(1)(B)).
    \50\ See Definitions Proposing Release, supra note 3. Persons 
wishing to comment on the definition of ``hedging or mitigating 
commercial risk'' should submit comments pursuant to the Definitions 
Proposing Release. For reference, proposed Exchange Act Rule 3a67-
4(a) reads as follows:
    ``Hedging or mitigating commercial risk
    For purposes of section 3(a)(67) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 
78c(a)(67) and Sec.  240.3a67-1 of this chapter, a security-based 
swap position shall be deemed to be held for the purpose of hedging 
or mitigating commercial risk when:
    (a) Such position is economically appropriate to the reduction 
of risks that are associated with the present conduct and management 
of a commercial enterprise, or are reasonably expected to arise in 
the future conduct and management of the commercial enterprise, 
where such risks arise from:
    (1) The potential change in the value of assets that a person 
owns, produces, manufactures, processes, or merchandises or 
reasonably anticipates owning, producing, manufacturing, processing, 
or merchandising in the ordinary course of business of the 
enterprise;
    (2) The potential change in the value of liabilities that a 
person has incurred or reasonably anticipates incurring in the 
ordinary course of business of the enterprise; or
    (3) The potential change in the value of services that a person 
provides, purchases, or reasonably anticipates providing or 
purchasing in the ordinary course of business of the enterprise;
    (b) Such position is:
    (1) Not held for a purpose that is in the nature of speculation 
or trading;
    (2) Not held to hedge or mitigate the risk of another security-
based swap position or swap position, unless that other position 
itself is held for the purpose of hedging or mitigating commercial 
risk as defined by this section or 17 CFR Sec.  1.3(ttt); and
    (c) The person holding the position satisfies the following 
additional conditions:
    (1) The person identifies and documents the risks that are being 
reduced by the security-based swap position;
    (2) The person establishes and documents a method of assessing 
the effectiveness of the security-based swap as a hedge; and
    (3) The person regularly assesses the effectiveness of the 
security-based swap as a hedge.''
    \51\ The Commission notes that certain portions of proposed Rule 
3a67-4 would be either inapplicable to, or would need to be 
interpreted in light of, the circumstances surrounding the end-user 
clearing exception. For example, subparagraph 3a67-4(c)(3) of the 
proposed Rule requires that a person regularly assess the 
effectiveness of the security-based swap as a hedge. Given that 
persons must determine whether the end-user clearing exception is 
available at the time the security-based swap is first confirmed, 
this portion of proposed Rule 3a67-4 is inapplicable for purposes of 
Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(1)(B). In addition, proposed Rule 3a67-4 
does not contemplate applying the definition of hedging or 
mitigating commercial risk to affiliates. Exchange Act Section 
3C(g)(4) creates certain additional requirements for affiliates of 
non-financial entities seeking to invoke the end-user clearing 
exception, and these requirements must also be satisfied for the 
end-user clearing exception to be available.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Request for Comment

    The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1. Additionally, the Commission requests comments on 
the following specific issues:
    <bullet> Are there reasons to believe that the proposed joint 
rulemaking by the Commission and the CFTC to define the meaning of 
certain terms used in the Exchange Act may affect the availability of 
the end-user clearing exception? If so, what specifically are the 
affects expected and what concerns do they raise?
    <bullet> Are there further distinctions or clarifications that 
should be made by the Commission for purposes of the end-user clearing 
exception that are different from those being made in connection with 
the proposed joint rulemaking by the Commission and the CFTC? If so, 
what are they and what would be the benefits of adopting them?
    <bullet> Are there technical requirements or details associated 
with terms used in the definition of ``financial entity'' in Exchange 
Act Section 3C(g)(3) that may have unexpected consequences when used in 
connection with the end-user clearing exception? Are there aspects of 
the CEA, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80), the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002), or 
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 184) that are 
incorporated in the definition that may need to be taken into 
consideration by the Commission to ensure the end-user clearing 
exception is available in appropriate circumstances? If so, what 
specific changes should the Commission consider and what would be the 
benefits of adopting them?
    <bullet> Should the Commission consider adopting a separate 
definition of ``hedging or mitigating commercial risk'' specifically 
designed to address the circumstances of the end-user clearing 
exception? If so, what are the specific considerations associated with 
the end-user clearing exception that make a separate rule desirable? 
What features would such a rule need in order to be effective and what 
would be the benefits of adopting them?
    <bullet> Should the Commission consider limiting or broadening the 
definition of ``hedging or mitigating commercial risk'' as it applies 
to the end-user clearing exception? For example, should security-based 
swaps subject to the end-user clearing exception be required to hedge 
or mitigate commercial risk on a single risk or an aggregate risk 
basis, and/or on a single entity or a consolidated basis? Are more 
specific industry-specific rules on hedging or rules that apply only to 
certain categories of asset classes appropriate at this time? Should 
security-based swaps facilitating asset optimization or dynamic hedging 
be included? Why or why not? Commenters are requested to discuss both 
the policy and legal bases underlying such comments.
    <bullet> If an entity is designated as a swap dealer, security-
based swap dealer, major swap participant or major security-based swap 
participant only for some of its swaps or security-based swaps, should 
it be treated as a financial entity under Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(3) 
and thereby be disqualified from invoking the end-user clearing 
exception for all of its security-based swaps? If so, why? If not, 
should the Commission require security-based swap dealers and major 
security-based swap participants in that position to separate or 
otherwise keep distinct those security-based swap activities for which 
they are designated as a security-based swap dealer or major security-
based swap participant from their other security-based swap activities? 
If so, how? If not, why not?

III. Required Consideration of a Clearing Exemption for Small Banks, 
Savings Associations, Farm Credit System Institutions and Credit Unions

    Mandatory clearing of security-based swaps is a central part of the 
reforms enacted by the Dodd-Frank Act and generally applies to 
financial entities without regard to size. However, Section 3C(g)(3)(B) 
of the Exchange Act requires the Commission to consider whether to 
exempt small banks, savings associations, farm credit systems

[[Page 80001]]

institutions and credit unions from the Exchange Act's definition of 
``financial entity'', including specifically those with total assets of 
$10,000,000,000 or less (``Identified Financial Institutions'').\52\ 
The advantages and disadvantages associated with mandatory clearing may 
be different with respect to certain types of financial entities and 
the Commission is required to consider whether such differences warrant 
granting an exemption for Identified Financial Institutions.\53\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \52\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(3)(B)).
    \53\ See Dodd-Lincoln Letter, supra note 23.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Identified Financial Institutions may use security-based swaps, 
and other derivatives to hedge or mitigate their business risks in ways 
that may be directly related to the business of banking. Under the 
definition of ``financial entity'' in the Dodd-Frank Act, however, 
these institutions would not qualify to use the end-user clearing 
exception unless further action is taken by the Commission. Depending 
on the extent to which an Identified Financial Institution relies on 
security-based swaps to manage its risk, the lack of an end-user 
exception could limit the availability, or raise associated initial 
costs, of security-based swaps for that institution.
    Alternatively, providing a blanket carve-out from the clearing 
requirement, albeit in connection with hedging transactions, for a 
class of financial entities could undercut the statutory goal of 
greater centralized clearing and the related benefits of efficiency and 
transparency. The Commission preliminarily does not believe that 
Identified Financial Institutions transact in securities-based swaps 
for hedging purposes in significant volume, but is requesting comments 
on this point. The Commission would also be interested in commenters' 
views on the practical impact of either permitting or prohibiting 
Identified Financial Institutions from using the end-user exception to 
effect securities-based swaps transactions, and how narrowly or broadly 
any exemption should be structured.\54\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \54\ See S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 34 (2010) (Report of the Senate 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs regarding The 
Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 discussing the 
end-user clearing exception and exceptions from bilateral reporting, 
capital and margin requirements, and stating that ``Some parts of 
the OTC market may not be suitable for clearing and exchange trading 
due to individual business needs of certain users. Those users 
should retain the ability to engage in customized, uncleared 
contracts while bringing in as much of the OTC market under the 
centrally cleared and exchange-traded framework as possible. Also, 
OTC (contracts not cleared centrally) should still be subject to 
reporting, capital, and margin requirements so that regulators have 
the tools to monitor and discourage potentially risky activities, 
except in very narrow circumstances. These exceptions should be 
crafted very narrowly with an understanding that every company, 
regardless of the type of business they are engaged in, has a strong 
commercial incentive to evade regulatory requirements.'')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In accordance with Section 3C(g)(3)(B) of the Exchange Act and 
taking the above considerations into account, the Commission is 
proposing alternative additional rule text under consideration in 
proposed Rules 3Cg-1(b) and (c) to exclude from the definition of 
``financial entity'' those banks, savings associations, farm credit 
systems institutions and credit unions with total assets of $10 billion 
or less falling within the definition of ``financial entity'' solely 
because of Section 3C(g)(3)(A)(viii) of the Exchange Act. The 
Commission preliminarily believes it would be appropriate to consider 
an alternative that contains an exemption for such entities at the $10 
billion total assets threshold because it would be consistent with the 
consideration contemplated in Section 3C(g)(3)(B) of the Exchange Act 
and because it may include financial institutions in the relevant 
categories that may face difficulties in meeting the burdens associated 
with a mandatory clearing requirement due to their limited operations 
or infrequent use of security-based swaps.
    Specifically, the alternative language would apply to a bank, as 
defined in Section 3(a)(6) of the Act, the deposits of which are 
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; a savings 
association, as defined in section 3(b) of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831), the deposits of which are insured by 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission; a farm credit system 
institution chartered under the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (12 U.S.C. 
2001); or an insured Federal credit union, State credit union or State-
chartered credit union under the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 
1752) falling within the definition of ``financial entity'' solely 
because of Section 3C(g)(3)(A)(viii) of the Exchange Act. The exemption 
would not be available to any institution that falls into any of the 
other seven categories specified in Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(3) for 
any reason. The $10 billion total asset threshold for these entities 
would be measured by reference to the total assets of the institution 
on the last day of the most recent fiscal year. The Commission believes 
it would be appropriate to consider such time frame for measurement of 
the $10 billion threshold in order to balance the need to maintain an 
updated assessment of the total asset threshold and the need to avoid 
frequently monitoring the ability to make use of the exemption.

Request for Comment

    The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1. In addition, to inform our consideration of 
whether it would be appropriate for the Commission to provide an 
exemption for Identified Financial Institutions, the Commission 
requests comments on the following specific issues:
    <bullet> Should the Commission grant an exemption from mandatory 
clearing requirements for Identified Financial Institutions? Would it 
be better for the Commission to simply require Identified Financial 
Institutions to follow the same clearing requirements as other 
financial entities? Why or why not?
    <bullet> Is the proposed alternative language in proposed Rules 
3Cg-1(b) and (c) sufficiently clear to allow Identified Financial 
Institutions to assess whether or not they would qualify to use the 
alternative proposed end-user clearing exception? Why or why not? If 
not, what steps could the Commission take to make the standards more 
clear and what would be the advantages or disadvantages of the 
alternative approach?
    <bullet> How significant are the aggregated activities of 
Identified Financial Institutions to the security-based swap market 
currently? Do the activities of such institutions have a material 
effect on the pricing of swaps, or contribute to an understanding of 
the security-based swap market? What is the aggregate gross exposure of 
security-based swaps held by Identified Financial Institutions? How 
would these activities and exposures change if such institutions were 
excluded from the mandatory clearing requirement? Is it possible that 
the activities of such institutions could change in a way such that 
they could have an effect on the pricing of security-based swaps if 
they are excluded from the mandatory clearing requirement? If so, what 
would be the effect on pricing of security-based swaps?
    <bullet> What types of security-based swap transactions do 
Identified Financial Institutions enter into and why? Are any risks 
presented by these types of transactions adequately addressed through 
the regulatory controls and business practices of Identified Financial 
Institutions? Should the Commission consider treating different types 
of security-based swaps differently when considering whether the end-
user clearing exception is

[[Page 80002]]

available for Identified Financial Institutions? If so, what specific 
distinctions should be considered by the Commission and what would be 
the advantages and disadvantages of adopting them?
    <bullet> Would there be any benefit for Identified Financial 
Institutions in receiving an exemption taking into account their 
anticipated activity in the security-based swap market? What would be 
the potential effects of granting an exemption for Identified Financial 
Institutions? What would be the effect on the security-based swap 
market? What would be the effect on the goals of promoting central 
clearing and reducing systemic risk?
    <bullet> If an exemption permitting Identified Financial 
Institutions to use the end-user clearing exception were to be adopted, 
should the Commission consider limiting the availability of the end-
user clearing exception to only some of the financial institutions 
identified in Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(3)(B)? Are there differences 
in the supervisory regimes applicable to banks, savings associations, 
farm credit institutions and credit unions that create material 
substantive differences between such institutions that are relevant for 
these purposes? If so, what specific distinctions should be considered 
by the Commission and what would be the benefits of adopting them?
    <bullet> Do Identified Financial Institutions commonly enter into 
security-based swaps? Would such institutions' behavior in respect of 
security-based swaps change if the end-user exception was extended or 
not extended to include them?
    <bullet> What would be the possible consequences of not proposing 
an exemption on the banking activities and operational practices of 
Identified Financial Institutions? Would the absence of an exemption 
prevent Identified Financial Institutions from providing or increase 
the costs of providing certain types of financial services to their 
customers or require them to make additional investments? If so, how? 
What types of services and what types of customers might be impacted? 
What types of investments might be required? Would the expected impact 
be justified by the systemic or other benefits of requiring mandatory 
clearing?
    <bullet> Is the $10,000,000,000 total asset threshold an 
appropriate point for the Commission to use when defining the 
availability of a clearing exception for Identified Financial 
Institutions? Should the threshold be lower? Should the threshold be 
higher? Is there a measure other than total assets, or a more precise 
definition of total assets, that should be used for these purposes, and 
if so, what would be the benefit of adopting the alternative measure?
    <bullet> What would be an appropriate frequency for measuring 
compliance with the $10,000,000,000 total asset threshold for entities? 
Is the proposed time frame too long or too short? If so, why? Are there 
any difficulties in measuring or monitoring such threshold? Would 
Identified Financial Institutions generally measure and monitor such 
thresholds as part of their normal business practices?

IV. General Request for Comments

    The Commission is requesting comments from all members of the 
public. The Commission will carefully consider the comments that it 
receives. The Commission seeks comment generally on all aspects of the 
proposed rule. In addition, the Commission seeks comment on the 
following:
    1. Should the Commission clarify or modify any of the definitions 
included in the proposed rules? If so, which definitions and what 
specific modifications are appropriate or necessary?
    2. Are the obligations in the proposed rule sufficiently clear? Is 
additional guidance from the Commission necessary?
    3. What are the technological or administrative burdens of 
complying with the rule proposed by the Commission? Does the method of 
collecting information contained in the proposed rule offer any 
technological or administrative advantages in comparison to other 
possible methods?
    4. Should the Commission implement substantive requirements in 
addition to, or in place of, the requirements in the proposed rule?
    In addition, the Commission seeks commenters' views regarding any 
potential impact of the proposal on non-financial entities expecting to 
invoke the end-user clearing exception, SDRs, other market 
participants, and the public generally. The Commission seeks comments 
on the proposal as a whole, including its interaction with the other 
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission seeks comments on 
whether the proposals would help achieve the broader goals of 
increasing transparency and accountability in the OTC derivatives 
market.
    The Commission requests comment generally on whether its proposed 
actions today to govern the exception to mandatory clearing of 
security-based swaps available under Exchange Act Section 3C(g) are 
necessary or appropriate for those purposes. If commenters do not 
believe the provisions of the proposed rule are necessary and 
appropriate, why not? What would be the preferred action?
    Title VII requires that the SEC consult and coordinate to the 
extent possible with the CFTC for the purposes of assuring regulatory 
consistency and comparability, to the extent possible, and states that 
in adopting rules, the CFTC and SEC shall treat functionally or 
economically similar products or entities in a similar manner.
    The CFTC is proposing rules related to an exception to mandatory 
clearing of swaps as required under Section 723(a) of the Dodd-Frank 
Act. Understanding that the Commission and the CFTC regulate different 
products and markets, and as such, appropriately may be proposing 
alternative regulatory requirements, we request comments on the impact 
of any differences between the Commission and CFTC approaches to the 
regulation of swap data repositories and SDRs, respectively. 
Specifically, do the regulatory approaches under the Commission's 
proposed rulemaking pursuant to Section 763(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act 
and the CFTC's proposed rulemaking pursuant to Section 723(a) of the 
Dodd-Frank Act result in duplicative or inconsistent efforts on the 
part of market participants subject to both regulatory regimes or 
result in gaps between those regimes? If so, in what ways do commenters 
believe that such duplication, inconsistencies, or gaps should be 
minimized? Do commenters believe the approaches proposed by the 
Commission and the CFTC to govern the end-user clearing exception to 
mandatory clearing of security-based swaps and swaps are comparable? If 
not, why? Do commenters believe there are approaches that would make 
the end-user clearing exceptions for security-based swaps and swaps 
more comparable? If so, what are they and what would be the benefits of 
adopting such approaches? Do commenters believe that it would be 
appropriate for us to adopt an approach proposed by the CFTC that 
differs from our proposal? If so, which one?
    Commenters should, when possible, provide the Commission with 
empirical data to support their views. Commenters suggesting 
alternative approaches should provide comprehensive proposals, 
including any conditions or limitations that they believe should apply, 
the reasons for their suggested approaches, and their analysis 
regarding why their suggested approaches would satisfy the statutory 
mandate contained in Section 763(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act

governing the exception to mandatory clearing of security-based swaps.

V. Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis

Proposed Rule 3Cg-1

    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1 Notice to the Commission [and Financial Entity 
Exemption] contains ``collection of information'' requirements within 
the meaning of the Paperwork reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et 
seq.). The Commission has submitted it to the Office of Management and 
Budget (``OMB'') for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 
CFR 1320.11. The title of the new collection of information under 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1 under the Exchange Act is ``Rule 3Cg-1 Notice to 
the Commission [and Financial Entity Exemption].'' OMB has not yet 
assigned a control number for the new collection of information 
contained in proposed Rule 3Cg-1 under the Exchange Act. An agency may 
not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control 
number.
A. Summary of Collection of Information
    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) under the Exchange Act would require a 
counterparty to a security-based swap transaction to meet the 
requirements of Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(1)(C) by delivering certain 
specified items of information to an SDR in the manner required by 
proposed Regulation SBSR.\55\ Whenever the end-user clearing exception 
is invoked, ten additional items of information would be required to be 
produced. If the counterparty invoking the end-user clearing exception 
is also an issuer of securities under Exchange Act Section 12 or 
required to file periodic reports with the Commission pursuant to 
Exchange Act Section 15(d) then two additional items of information 
would also be required for a total of twelve items of information 
required to be produced. In either case, this additional information 
collected in the form and manner required by Regulation SBSR would 
serve as the official notice to the Commission of a security-based swap 
transaction that is made in reliance on the end-user clearing 
exception.\56\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \55\ See supra, notes 21-37 and accompanying text. Proposed 
Regulation SBSR would specify who reports security-based swap 
transactions, where such transactions are to be reported, what 
information is to be reported, and in what format. The information 
required under proposed Exchange Act Rule 3Cg-1 would be in addition 
to these requirements but would be delivered to the SDR by the 
Reporting Party in the same manner as required by proposed 
Regulation SBSR. Regulation SBSR contemplates that information may 
be delivered to the Commission directly in limited circumstances 
when an SDR is not available. When permitted by Regulation SBSR, 
such delivery would also meet the end-user clearing exception notice 
requirement.
    \56\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(1)(C)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Proposed Use of Information
    The collection of information in proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) serves two 
purposes contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act. First, the proposed Rule 
identifies what a party to a security-based swap transaction must do to 
satisfy the statutory requirement in Exchange Act 3C(g)(1)(C) to 
provide notice to the Commission if it invokes the end-user clearing 
exception.\57\ Second, the Commission expects the empirical data 
collected under Rule 3Cg-1(a) will aid efforts to prevent abuse of the 
end-user clearing exception by allowing it to evaluate how the end-user 
clearing exception is being used, identify areas of potential concern 
and take prompt action to limit abuses in appropriate 
circumstances.\58\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Respondents
    The proposed collection of information in proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) 
would apply to transactions that qualify for the end-user clearing 
exception under Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(1) where at least one of the 
parties to the security-based swap is not included in the definition of 
financial entity and is using the security-based swap to hedge or 
mitigate commercial risk. For an entity to determine whether it is not 
a financial entity and whether it is using the security-based swap 
transaction to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, the party must first 
make an assessment under the applicable definition of financial entity 
in Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(3) \59\ and then consider whether the 
definition of hedging or mitigating commercial risk in proposed Rule 
3a67-4 applies to the security-based swap in question.\60\ In addition, 
those entities that may be considered Identified Financial Institutions 
and therefore fall within the exemption under the proposed alternative 
language in Rule 3Cg-1(b) and (c) would be required to conduct an 
assessment under the proposed alternative language to determine whether 
they are entitled to elect to use the end-user clearing exception.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \59\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(3)(A)(i)-(viii)).
    \60\ See Definitions Proposing Release, supra note 3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Based on the information currently available to the Commission, the 
Commission preliminarily estimates there are roughly 5,000 entities in 
the credit default swaps marketplace.\61\ The Commission preliminarily 
estimates that 1,000 of these entities regularly participate in the 
market for credit default swaps and other security-based swaps to an 
extent that may lead them to be reporting persons for purposes of 
proposed Regulation SBSR. In addition, the Commission estimates that 
there may be up to another 4,000 security-based swap counterparties 
\62\ that transact security-based swaps much less frequently.\63\ The 
Commission preliminarily believes the 1,000 regular participants in the 
security-based swaps market are likely to be entities that are 
financial entities for purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act and would 
therefore not qualify for the end-user clearing exception, while the 
4,000 less frequent counterparties to security-based swaps could, for 
purposes of the end-user clearing exception, be non-financial entities 
using security-based swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. These 
4,000 counterparties are also preliminarily believed by the Commission 
to include Identified Financial Institutions using security-based 
swaps.\64\ Accordingly, with respect to burdens applicable to all 
security-based swap counterparties that qualify for the end-user 
clearing exception, the Commission preliminarily believes that it is 
reasonable to use the figure of 4,000 respondents for purposes of 
estimating collection of information burdens under the PRA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \61\ See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, supra note 16.
    \62\ Id.
    \63\ This figure is based on the 5,000 total participants in the 
security-based swap market minus the 1,000 of those participants 
that qualify as financial entities.
    \64\ For purposes of the discussion that follows, the term 
``non-financial entities'' includes Identified Financial 
Institutions that would be excluded from the definition of 
``financial entity'' in Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(3) in the event 
the proposed alternative language in Rules 3Cg-1(b) and (c) is 
adopted by the Commission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens
    The Commission preliminarily believes the notification required by 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1 \65\ imposes a limited reporting or recordkeeping 
burden, because it references commonly used market practices when 
defining whether a security-based swap hedges

[[Page 80004]]

or mitigates commercial risk \66\ and utilizes the proposed reporting 
and recordkeeping mechanism under Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR to meet 
the notice requirement contemplated by Exchange Act Section 
3C(g)(1)(C).\67\ Under proposed Rule 3Cg-1 the additional reporting 
burden on the party invoking the end-user clearing exception would be 
to identify and document the commercial risk being hedged and the 
effectiveness of the proposed security-based swap as a hedge, and then 
complete ten or, at the most, twelve additional data points in a larger 
set of transaction information that would be required to submitted to 
an SDR or the Commission under proposed Regulation SBSR. In addition, 
those entities that may be considered Identified Financial Institutions 
and therefore fall within the exemption under the proposed alternative 
language in Rule 3Cg-1(b) and (c) would be required to conduct an 
assessment under the proposed alternative language to determine whether 
they are entitled to elect to use the end-user clearing exception. The 
recordkeeping burden on the SDR would also be limited to storing the 
additional ten or twelve data points in the larger set of transaction 
information separately required to be delivered pursuant to proposed 
Regulation SBSR.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \65\ For purposes of the discussion that follows, references to 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1 are to proposed Rule 3Cg-1 including the 
alternative proposed rule text, unless otherwise noted.

    \67\ See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, supra note 16.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Estimated Number of Security-Based Swap Transactions
    According to publicly available data from the Depository Trust 
Clearing Corporation (``DTCC'') recently, there have been an average of 
approximately 20,000 new transactions in single-name credit default 
swap (``CDS'') transactions per day,\68\ corresponding to a total 
number of CDS transactions of approximately 5,200,000 per year.\69\ The 
Commission preliminarily believes that CDS represent 85% of all 
security-based swap transactions.\70\ Accordingly, and to the extent 
that historical market activity is a reasonable predictor of future 
activity,\71\ the Commission preliminarily estimates that the total 
number of security-based swap transactions that would be subject to 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1 on an annual basis would be approximately 
6,200,000.\72\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \68\ See, e.g., ``Table 17: Summary of Weekly Transaction 
Activity,'' <a href="http://www.dtcc.com/products/derivserv/data_table_iii.php">http://www.dtcc.com/products/derivserv/data_table_iii.php</a> (weekly data as updated by DTCC).
    \69\ Cf., Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, supra note 16, 
which used an estimate of 36,000 transactions in single name CDS 
transactions per day, referencing the same DTCC data. The difference 
is accounted for by differences in the scope of proposed Rule 3Cg-1 
compared to proposed Regulation SBSR. Proposed Regulation SBSR 
encompasses both new transactions in security-based swaps and 
certain transactions occurring during the lifecycle of security-
based swaps and therefore both of these elements are taken into 
account for purposes of its discussion of estimated burdens to be 
experienced by respondents as a result of the proposed regulation. 
Proposed Rule 3Cg-1 would only affect new transactions and therefore 
the estimated number of transactions used for purposes of the burden 
calculations is limited to new transactions.
    \70\ The Commission's estimate is based on internal analysis of 
available security-based swap market data. The Commission is seeking 
comment about the overall size of the security-based swap market.
    \71\ The Commission notes that regulation of the security-based 
swap markets, including by means of proposed Regulation SBSR and 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1, could impact market participant behavior.
    \72\ This figure is based on the following: (5,200,000/0.85) = 
6,117,647.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Based on publicly available information and consultation with 
industry sources, the Commission preliminarily believes that even the 
most active non-financial entity participants in the security-based 
swap market enter a relatively small number of new security-based swaps 
during any given period.\73\ There are approximately 4,000 participants 
in the security-based swap marketplace that the Commission 
preliminarily believes could qualify for the end-user clearing 
exception and they represent approximately 80% of the total number of 
participants in the security-based swap market.\74\ However, based on 
all information reviewed the Commission preliminarily estimates that 
non-financial entities account for 1% of all security-based swap 
transactions.\75\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \73\ Information from ISDA surveys relating to collateralized 
swap transactions indicate that the average number of outstanding 
OTC derivative trades for non-bank firms generally average just 1% 
of all transactions in the marketplace, and this figure includes 
transactions associated with certain parties not entitled to invoke 
the end-user clearing exception, such as certain major swap 
participants, commodity pools as defined in section 1a(10) of the 
Commodity Exchange Act and private funds as defined in section 
202(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. See ISDA Collateral 
Committee, ISDA Feasibility Study: Extending Collateralized 
Portfolio Reconciliations (Dec. 18, 2009) (available at <a href="http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/ISDA-Portfolio-Reconciliation-Feasibility-Study.pdf">http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/ISDA-Portfolio-Reconciliation-Feasibility-Study.pdf</a>). The Commission is seeking comment about the 
overall size of the security-based swap market.
    \74\ This 80% figure is based on the quotient of dividing the 
4,000 participants that could qualify for the end-user clearing 
exception by the estimated 5,000 participants in the security-based 
swaps marketplace.
    \75\ See supra note 73. An estimate that non-financial entities 
account for 1% of security-based swap transactions will be used for 
purposes of the calculations that follow below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens
    To qualify for the end-user clearing exception proposed Rule 3Cg-
1(a)(4) would require a non-financial entity to determine whether the 
terms of the proposed security-based swap and the manner in which it 
will be used satisfy the definition of hedging or mitigating commercial 
risk established by proposed Exchange Act Rule 3a67-4. To meet the 
requirements of the definition, subsection 3a67-4(a)(3) of proposed 
Rule 3a67-4 specifies that the counterparty to the security-based swap 
must identify and document one or more risks associated with the 
present or future conduct and management of the enterprise that are 
being reduced by the security-based swap and establish and document a 
method of assessing the effectiveness of the security-based swap as a 
hedge for such identified risks. In complying with proposed Rule 3a67-
4, non-financial entities seeking to invoke the end-user clearing 
exception would need to establish and maintain an appropriate 
compliance mechanism including the necessary professional, legal, 
technical and administrative support to make and document the required 
assessment of hedging effectiveness.\76\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \76\ See Definitions Proposing Release, supra note 3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission preliminarily believes that counterparties 
transacting in security-based swaps to hedge commercial risks 
ordinarily will have established risk management or financial control 
systems in place for other reasons which will likely be adjusted to 
accommodate the requirements of proposed Rule 3a67-4(a)(3).\77\ 
Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily estimates that designing and 
implementing an appropriate compliance and support program to estimate 
the hedging effectiveness of security-based swaps would impose an 
initial one time aggregate burden of approximately 44,000 hours, 
corresponding to 11 burden hours for

[[Page 80005]]

each reporting party, to adjust these established risk management or 
financial control systems to accommodate the requirements of proposed 
Rule 3a67-4.\78\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \77\ The Commission preliminarily believes some entities 
establish and follow these types of procedures so that their hedging 
transactions will qualify for hedge accounting treatment under 
generally accepted accounting principles, which require procedures 
similar to those contained in this proposed rule, or to meet other 
statutory requirements. While hedging relationships involving 
security-based swaps that qualify for the hedging or mitigating 
commercial risk exception within the proposed rule are not limited 
to those recognized as hedges for accounting purposes, we believe 
that entities that are not seeking hedge accounting treatment for 
their hedging transactions commonly identify and document their risk 
management activities as well as assess the effectiveness of those 
activities as a matter of good business practice. See also Item 305 
of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.305 (requiring SEC Filers to provide 
identified risk based disclosures relating to their activities in 
financial derivatives); Internal revenue Code Section 1259 (26 
U.S.C. 1259) (recognizing hedging transactions as ``constructive 
sales'' of certain appreciated financial positions in specified 
circumstances).
    \78\ This figure is based on the following: (Senior Business 
Analyst at 4 hours) + (Compliance Manager at 4 hours) + (Director of 
Compliance at 2 hours) + (Compliance Attorney at 1 hour) x (4000 
respondents) = 44,000 burden hours; (44,000 burden hours per year)/
(4000 respondents) = 11 burden hours per year per respondent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission preliminarily estimates that to gather the 
information required to notify the Commission that a security-based 
swap is being used to hedge or mitigate commercial risk purposes of 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(4) would impose an ongoing aggregate annual 
burden of approximately 62,000 burden hours for all respondents, which 
corresponds to an ongoing annual aggregate burden of approximately 16 
burden hours for each respondent.\79\ The Commission further 
preliminarily estimates that for a party to make an assessment required 
under proposed Rules 3Cg-1(b) and (c) of the proposed alternative rule 
text, if applicable, gather the remaining information required by 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) and include the information in the security-
based swap information delivered to an SDR as contemplated by proposed 
Regulation SBSR would impose an ongoing aggregate annual burden of 
approximately 31,000 burden hours for all respondents, which 
corresponds to an ongoing aggregate annual burden of approximately 
eight (8) burden hours for each respondent,\80\ as each item of 
additional information is factual information known to the party 
invoking the end-user clearing exception and unlikely to vary from 
transaction to transaction.\81\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \79\ These figures are based on the following: (((Senior 
Business Analyst at 30 minutes) + (Compliance Manager at 30 
minutes)) x (6,200,000 security-based swap transactions) x (1% 
transactions by parties eligible to invoke end-user clearing 
exception)))/60 minutes = 62,000 burden hours per year; (62,000 
burden hours per year)/4,000 respondents = 15.5 burden hours per 
year per respondent.
    \80\ These figures are based on the following: ((Compliance 
Manager at 30 minutes) x (6,200,000 security-based swap 
transactions) x (1% transactions by parties eligible to invoke end-
user clearing exception))/60 minutes = 31,000 burden hours per year; 
(31,000 burden hours per year)/4,000 respondents = 7.75 burden hours 
per year per respondent.
    \81\ For example, the Commission preliminarily expects that a 
counterparty's status as a non-financial entity, a finance affiliate 
or an SEC Filer would change infrequently. The Commission 
understands the time required to collect this information is likely 
to vary depending on whether the particular security-based swap is 
documented using electronic or manual processes. Electronic 
processes allow for fields of required information to be populated 
automatically, substantially reducing the time required for 
transaction processing and compliance confirmation. A high 
percentage of electronically eligible security-based swaps are 
currently transacted using electronic processes. See ISDA, 2010 ISDA 
Operations Benchmarking Survey (available at <a href="http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/ISDA-Operations-Survey-2010.pdf">http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/ISDA-Operations-Survey-2010.pdf</a>) (showing that for credit 
derivatives 99% of transactions are eligible to be confirmed 
electronically and 98% of eligible transactions are confirmed 
electronically, while for equity derivatives 36% of transactions are 
eligible to be confirmed electronically and 81% of eligible 
transactions are confirmed electronically). The Commission 
preliminarily believes CDS transactions represent 85% of all 
security-based swap transactions. See supra note 69. The 30 minutes 
of time estimated to be required to produce the information to 
comply with proposed Rule 3Cg-1 (other than the hedging or 
mitigating commercial risk requirement) is intended to account for 
both manually and electronically processed transactions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 3Cg-1 
would impose minimal additional burdens on either Reporting Parties not 
using the end-user clearing exception themselves or on SDRs. Reporting 
Parties would be required by proposed Regulation SBSR to report 
transaction information relating to security-based swaps in a specified 
manner, and the Commission therefore preliminarily believes reporting a 
limited number of additional data elements to the SDR in an equivalent 
manner will have a de minimis effect on the burdens they experience. 
Similarly, the Commission preliminarily believes that for an SDR to 
receive and retain these additional data fields would effectively 
impose minimal additional burdens, as the information would be 
transmitted and received electronically and would then be stored as 
part of the existing transaction data already required under proposed 
Regulation SBSR.
    For the reasons described above, the Commission preliminarily 
estimates that the initial one-time aggregate burden associated with 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1 would be 44,000 hours, corresponding to 11 burden 
hours for each respondent,\82\ and the recurring aggregate annualized 
burden associated with proposed Rule 3Cg-1 would be 93,000 burden 
hours, which corresponds to 23 annual burden hours per respondent.\83\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \82\ See supra note 78 and accompanying text.
    \83\ This figure is the sum of the calculations presented in 
notes 79 and 80 above. Summation differences between the final 
figures in the body of the text are due to the effects of rounding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. Collection of Information Is Mandatory
    The collection of information under proposed Rule 3Cg-1 would be 
mandatory when a security-based swap counterparty chooses to invoke the 
end-user clearing exception.
F. Record Retention Period
    Information collected pursuant to proposed Rule 3Cg-1 would be 
required to be retained for not less than five years. The Commission 
recently proposed to adopt rules to regulate the operation of SDRs, 
which include recordkeeping requirements for security-based swap 
transaction data reported to a registered SDR pursuant to proposed 
Regulation SBSR. Specifically, proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(5) would require 
registered SDRs to maintain the transaction data for not less than five 
years after the applicable security-based swap expires and historical 
positions and historical market values for not less than five 
years.\84\ Exchange Act Section 13A(c) \85\ requires each party to a 
non-cleared security-based swap to maintain records of the security-
based swaps held by such party in the form required by the Commission, 
and Exchange Act Section 13A(d) \86\ mandates that these records must 
be in a form not less comprehensive than required to be collected by 
SDRs. These records are available for inspection by the Commission and 
other specified authorities pursuant to Exchange Act Section 
13A(c)(2).\87\ Accordingly, security-based swap transaction reports 
received by a registered SDR pursuant to proposed Rule 3Cg-1 and 
proposed Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR would be required to be retained 
for not less than five years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Law 111-203, Sec.  763(i) (adding Exchange Act Section 13(n)(5)).

Section 13A(c)(2)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

G. Responses to Collection of Information Will Be Kept Confidential
    A registered SDR would be under a general obligation to maintain 
the confidentiality of all information collected pursuant to proposed 
Rule 3Cg-1 and proposed Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR, subject to limited 
exceptions under proposed Regulation SDR.\88\ The Commission also 
preliminarily believes that the additional information collected 
pursuant to proposed Rule 3Cg-1 would either fall under the exception 
to public dissemination contained in proposed Rule 902(c)(2), or 
otherwise should be excluded from the publicly-disseminated transaction 
report.\89\ Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes the 
collection of

[[Page 80006]]

information pursuant to proposed Rule 3Cg-1 would be confidential and 
would not be publicly available.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \88\ See Regulation SDR Release, supra note 42.
    \89\ See supra note 47 and accompanying text.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To the extent that the Commission receives confidential information 
pursuant this collection of information, such information would be kept 
confidential, subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information 
Act (``FOIA''). Exemption 4 of FOIA provides an exemption for ``trade 
secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person 
and privileged or confidential'' \90\ The information required to be 
submitted to the Commission under proposed Rule 3Cg-1 may contain 
proprietary financial information regarding security-based swap 
transactions and therefore be subject to protection from disclosure 
under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.

H. Request for Comment
    Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3505(c)(2)(B), the Commission solicits 
comment to:
    1. Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the performance of the functions of the agency, including 
whether the information shall have practical utility;
    2. Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information;
    3. Enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and
    4. Minimize the burden of collection of information on those who 
are to respond, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology.
    Persons wishing to submit comments on the collection of information 
requirements should direct them to the following persons: (1) Desk 
Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3208, New Executive 
Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; and (2) Secretary, Securities 
and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549-1090 
with reference to File No. S7-43-10. OMB is required to make a decision 
concerning the collection of information between 30 and 60 days after 
publication, so a comment to OMB is best assured of having its full 
effect if OMB receives it within 30 days of publication. The Commission 
has submitted the proposed collection of information to OMB for 
approval. Requests for the materials submitted to OMB by the Commission 
with regard to this collection of information should be in writing, 
refer to File No. S7-43-10, and be submitted to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, 100 F 
Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549-0213.

VI. Analysis of Costs and Benefits of the Proposed Rule

    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1 implements the requirements of Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g) which provides an exception to the general requirement 
that a security-based swap must be cleared provided that one party to 
the security-based swap (1) Is not a financial entity, (2) is using 
security-based swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, and (3) 
notifies the Commission, in a manner set forth by the Commission, how 
it generally meets its financial obligations associated with entering 
into non-cleared security-based swaps. The application of the end-user 
clearing exception is solely at the discretion of the counterparty to 
the security-based swap that meets the conditions of Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(1). Section 3C(g) specifically preserves the ability of 
counterparties qualifying for the end-user clearing exception to elect 
to clear a security-based swap when a clearing agency is available and 
to select the clearing agency at which the security-based swap will be 
cleared.
    The purpose of mandatory clearing of security-based swap products 
is to centralize individual counterparty risks through a clearing 
agency acting as a central counterparty that distributes risk among the 
clearing agency's participants. When effective, centralization of 
counterparty risks through clearing reduces the likelihood that 
defaults propagate between counterparties by establishing and enforcing 
margin requirements based on risk-based models and parameters designed 
to limit the possibility that participants will be exposed to losses 
they cannot anticipate or control. Effective central clearing can also 
lessen the risk of capital flight from a dealer that becomes 
economically distressed. In particular, without central clearing, a 
solvency concern at a major dealer could be made worse by its 
counterparties quickly moving to other dealers.\91\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \91\ Darrell Duffie and Haoxiang Zhu, ``Does a Central Clearing 
Counterparty Reduce Counterparty Risk?,'' (Stanford University, 
Working Paper, 2010) (available at http://www.stanford.edu/~duffie/
DuffieZhu.pdf).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    However, mandatory clearing of security-based swap products may 
also alter the burdens on non-financial end-users of derivatives 
relative to bilateral transactions, including direct costs associated 
with clearing fees and additional margin requirements and indirect 
costs associated with using derivatives less tailored to their 
individual business needs and thereby possibly affect their risk 
management practices.\92\ Exchange Act Section 3C(g) is designed to 
permit non-financial end-users that meet the specified conditions to 
elect not to centrally clear security-based swaps and retain 
flexibility to use both cleared and non-cleared security-based swaps in 
their risk management activities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \92\ See supra note 11 and accompanying text.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Notification to the Commission

    Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(1)(C) requires a non-financial entity 
that uses security-based swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk to 
notify the Commission how it generally meets its financial obligations 
associated with non-cleared security-based swaps in order for the end-
user clearing exception to be available.\93\ Section 3C(g)(1)(C) 
contemplates that the Commission may establish the manner of 
notification and Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(6) provides that the 
Commission may prescribe such rules as may be necessary to prevent 
abuse of the end-user clearing exception. In accordance with Exchange 
Act Sections 3C(g)(1)(C) and 3C(g)(6), proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) requires 
that notification be given to the Commission by delivering specified 
information to a registered SDR or the Commission with each security-
based swap transaction that invokes the end-user clearing exception in 
the manner required by proposed new Regulation SBSR under the Exchange 
Act.\94\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \93\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(1)(c)).
    \94\ See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, supra note 16.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Meeting Financial Obligations
    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5) requires the reporting of five specified 
items of information to satisfy the requirement under the Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(1)(C) for a non-financial entity invoking the end-user 
clearing exception to notify the Commission of ``how it generally meets 
its financial obligations associated with non-cleared security-based 
swaps.'' Because non-cleared security-based swaps are not subject to 
uniform margin and collateral requirements such as those established by 
clearing agencies, providing this information will be useful in 
monitoring the extent to which non-financial entities that invoke the 
end-user exception are taking steps to mitigate credit risks associated 
with security-based swaps.

[[Page 80007]]

    In order to understand these potential risks, proposed Rule 3Cg-
1(a)(5) requires a counterparty invoking the end-user clearing 
exception to provide notification regarding how they expect to meet 
their financial obligations associated with the security-based swap by 
reporting specified information to a registered security-based swap 
depository. In particular, an entity invoking the end-user clearing 
exception must indicate in the materials provided to the SDR whether it 
provides security for the performance of its financial obligations by 
(i) Transferring assets directly to the security-based swap 
counterparty pursuant to a written credit support agreement; (ii) 
pledging collateral pursuant to a security arrangement not requiring 
the transfer of collateral to the security-based swap counterparty; 
(iii) receiving credit support from a third-party pursuant to a written 
guarantee; (iv) solely relying on its available financial resources; or 
(v) using other means.
a. Benefits
    Requiring end-users to provide the Commission with general 
information regarding their arrangements to meet financial obligations 
associated with non-cleared security-based swaps may confer benefits by 
reducing concerns about the potential risks that these market 
participants introduce into the financial markets in the absence of 
central clearing. The notification will also allow the Commission to 
understand how margining and other credit support practices may affect 
the prices and liquidity of security-based swaps, including by 
comparing and contrasting the trading costs of non-cleared security-
based swaps with different credit support characteristics to each other 
and to security-based swaps that are cleared. Proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5) 
also establishes a reporting option for ``other means'' that may be 
used to meet financial obligations associated with non-cleared 
security-based swaps providing the Commission with insight on the 
possible emergence of new and currently less common methods of 
mitigating financial risks associated with non-cleared security-based 
swaps that may arise as the market develops.
b. Costs
    The Commission preliminarily estimates the costs associated with 
the notification required by Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5) will be limited, as the 
methods used to meet financial obligations associated with non-cleared 
security-based swaps are expected to be readily known to counterparties 
invoking the end-user clearing exception and unlikely to vary from 
transaction to transaction. The Commission preliminarily estimates 
there are 6,200,000 transactions in security-based swaps annually,\95\ 
and that parties eligible to invoke the end-user clearing exception are 
counterparties in approximately 1% of all security-based swap 
transactions.\96\ The Commission preliminarily estimates that to gather 
the information required for purposes of complying with proposed Rule 
3Cg-1(a)(5) would impose an ongoing aggregate annual burden of 
approximately 15,500 burden hours for all respondents, which 
corresponds to a burden of four (4) burden hours for each 
respondent.\97\ Accordingly, applying an estimated hourly cost of $316 
for a compliance attorney to gather information about how the 
counterparty is meeting its Financial Notice Obligation,\98\ the 
Commission preliminarily estimates proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5) would 
result in an ongoing aggregate annual cost of $4,900,000 to the entire 
end-user community, which corresponds to an average ongoing aggregate 
annual cost of $1,225 per end-user.\99\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \95\ See supra note 72 and accompanying text.
    \96\ Based on the information presented in note 73 above and the 
accompanying text, the Commission preliminarily estimates entities 
qualifying for the end-user exception are involved in roughly 1% of 
the estimated 6,200,000 annual security-based swap transactions, or 
62,000 such transactions ((6,200,000 x 1%) = 62,000).
    \97\ See supra note 80 and accompanying text. The estimates that 
follow are based on an assumption that the burden of complying with 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5) is equivalent to the burden of complying 
with the other requirements of proposed Rule 3Cg-1, not including 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(4).
    \98\ The hourly rate for the compliance attorney is from SIFMA's 
Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2009, 
modified by the Commission's staff to account for an 1800-hour work-
year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, 
employee benefits and overhead. The remaining hourly rates for 
professionals used in this cost benefit analysis section are also 
derived from this source and modified in the same manner.
    \99\ These monetized costs are calculated as follows: (15 
minutes/60 minutes per hour) x ($316 dollars per hour) x (62,000 
security-based swap transactions annually) = $4,898,000 annually; 
($4,898,000 annually)/4,000 respondents = $1,225 average annually 
per respondent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Preventing Abuse of the End-User Clearing Exception
    To aid the Commission's efforts to prevent abuse of the end-user 
clearing exception, proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) requires notification of 
which of the counterparties to the security-based swap is invoking the 
end-user clearing exception, whether the counterparty invoking the 
exception is or is not a financial entity, whether the counterparty 
invoking the exception is a finance affiliate meeting the requirements 
of Exchange Act 3C(g)(4), whether the counterparty invoking the 
exception uses the security-based swap to hedge or mitigate commercial 
risk, and whether the counterparty invoking the exception is an SEC 
Filer. SEC Filers invoking the end-user clearing exception must provide 
their SEC Central Index Key number and confirm that an appropriate 
committee of the SEC Filer's board of directors or equivalent body has 
reviewed and approved the decision to enter into the security-based 
swap that is subject to the end-user clearing exception.
a. Benefits
    Requiring notification of the above-listed information would 
provide regulators with information about the end-user that could help 
verify that the end-user clearing exception is being invoked by market 
participants appropriately. The requirement to identify which 
counterparty is invoking the end-user clearing exception is critical in 
making this determination. Similarly, since Exchange Act Section 3C(g) 
limits the availability of the end-user clearing exception to non-
financial entities and counterparties hedging or the mitigating 
commercial risk, an affirmative notification to the Commission that 
these two factors are satisfied will help verify eligibility of the 
counterparty to invoke the exception. Given the nature of the specific 
provisions in the Exchange Act governing use of the end-user clearing 
exception by finance affiliates,\100\ separately identifying 
transactions involving finance affiliates will also help to ensure 
these requirements are complied with over time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \100\ See Public Law 111-203, sec. 763(a) (adding Exchange Act 
Section 3C(g)(4)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission preliminarily expects counterparties to security-
based swaps invoking the end-user clearing exception would frequently 
be entities that have raised capital in public financial markets and 
are therefore regulated by the Commission.\101\ Entities registered 
under the Exchange Act Section 12 or required to file reports pursuant 
to the Exchange Act Section 15(d) are generally required to include a 
discussion of qualitative and quantitative elements of market risk in 
annual reports filed with the Commission, including a discussion of

[[Page 80008]]

how derivatives are used to manage risk.\102\ Notification by an end-
user that it is subject to this requirement would allow regulators to 
review how frequently SEC Filers use the end-user clearing exception 
and better understand how security-based swaps are used by SEC Filers 
to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. The proposed requirement that SEC 
Filers invoking the end-user clearing exception provide the relevant 
Commission file number will allow the Commission to cross reference 
information received in connection with the end-user clearing exception 
with other Commission documents more easily. The additional proposed 
requirement that SEC Filers indicate whether a committee of the board 
of directors (or equivalent body) reviewed and approved the decision to 
enter into the security-based swap that is the subject of the end-user 
clearing exception would serve as confirmation that the requirements of 
Exchange Act Section 3C(i) applicable to SEC Filers were completed.

    \101\ See Coalition for Derivatives End-Users comment (September 
20, 2010), pursuant to Definitions Contained in Title VII of Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Exchange Act 
Rel. No. 34-62,717, 75 FR 51,429 (Aug. 20, 2010).
    \102\ See Item 305 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.305. The 
Commission does not require companies with a public common equity 
float of less than $75 million, or, if a company is unable to 
calculate public equity float, less than $50 million in revenue in 
the last fiscal year to provide quantitative and qualitative 
disclosure about market risk as required of larger companies under 
Regulation S-K. See Smaller Reporting Company Regulatory Relief and 
Simplification, Securities Act Release No. 8876, Exchange Act 
Release No. 56994, Trust Indenture Act No. 2451 (Dec. 19, 2007), 73 
FR 934 (Jan. 4, 2008).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

b. Costs
    To qualify for the end-user clearing exception a non-financial 
entity would be required to determine whether the terms of the proposed 
security-based swap and the manner in which it will be used satisfy the 
definition of hedging or mitigating commercial risk established by 
proposed Exchange Act Rule 3a67-4. To meet the requirements of the 
definition, subsection 3a67-4(a)(3) of proposed Rule 3a67-4 specifies 
that the counterparty to the security-based swap must identify and 
document one or more risks associated with the present or future 
conduct and management of the enterprise and establish and document a 
method of assessing the effectiveness of the security-based swap as a 
hedge for such identified risks.
    The Commission preliminarily believes that non-financial entities 
seeking to invoke the end-user clearing exception would need to 
establish and maintain an appropriate compliance mechanism to meet the 
hedge or mitigate standard in proposed Rule 3a67-4 including the 
necessary professional, legal, technical and administrative support to 
make and document the required assessment of hedging 
effectiveness.\103\ The Commission also preliminarily believes that 
counterparties transacting in security-based swaps to hedge commercial 
risks ordinarily will have established risk management systems in place 
for other reasons that can be adjusted to accommodate the requirements 
of proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(4) and proposed Rule 3a67-4.\104\ 
Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily estimates that designing and 
implementing an appropriate compliance and support program to identify 
the risks being reduced and document the hedging effectiveness of 
security-based swaps would impose an initial one time initial aggregate 
cost of $13,200,000 to all end-users, which corresponds to an average 
initial cost of $3300 per end-user.\105\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \103\ See supra note 76 and accompanying text.
    \104\ See supra note 77 and accompanying text.
    \105\ This figure is based on the following: (Senior Business 
Analyst at 4 hours x $234 per hour) + (Compliance Manager at 4 hours 
x $294 per hour) + (Director of Compliance at 2 hours x $426 per 
hour) + (Compliance Attorney at 1 hour x $316 per hour) x (4000 
respondents) = $13,120,000; ($13,120,000 initial aggregate cost)/
(4000 respondents) = $3,280 initial aggregate cost per respondent. 
See also supra note 78.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission expects there would also be ongoing costs associated 
with determining whether the hedging or mitigating commercial risk 
standard is met for each security-based swap transaction for which the 
end-user clearing exception is invoked. The Commission preliminarily 
estimates that to gather the information required for purposes of 
complying with proposed Rule 3a67-4 and proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(4) would 
impose an ongoing aggregate annual burden of approximately 62,000 
burden hours for all respondents, which corresponds to a burden of 16 
burden hours for each respondent.\106\ Assuming an hourly cost of $234 
per hour for a senior business analyst and $294 per hour for a 
compliance manager to meet this requirement, proposed Rule 3Cg-1 would 
impose an annual cost of $16,400,000 to all end-users and an average 
annual cost of $4,100 dollars per end-user.\107\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \106\ See supra note 79 and accompanying text. The estimates 
that follow are based on an assumption that the burden of complying 
with proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5) is equivalent to the burden of 
complying with the requirements of proposed Rule 3Cg-1, not 
including proposed Rules 3Cg-1(a)(4), given the comparable nature of 
the information required.
    \107\ This figure is based on the following: ((Senior Business 
Analyst at 30 minutes x $234 per hour) + (Compliance Manager at 30 
minutes x $294 per hour)) x ((6,200,000 security-based swap 
transactions) x (1% transactions by parties eligible to invoke end-
user clearing exception)) = $16,368,000 aggregate ongoing costs per 
year; ($16,368,000 aggregate ongoing costs per year)/(4,000 
respondents) = $4,092 in aggregate ongoing costs per year per 
respondent. These figures do not include the costs associated with 
complying with proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5), which are separately 
accounted for in note 99 above and the accompanying text, or costs 
associated with proposed Rule 3Cg-1 other than proposed Rules 3Cg-
1(a)(4) and (5), which are separately accounted for in note 112 
below and the accompanying text. See also supra note 79.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It was estimated that to make an assessment required under proposed 
Rules 3Cg-1(b) and (c) of the alternative proposed rule text, if 
applicable, gather the information required by Rule 3Cg-1(a) besides 
the information with respect to hedging or mitigating commercial risk, 
would require the additional work of a compliance manager.\108\ That 
information is factual information a party is likely to have as a 
result of its existing compliance process and the information is 
unlikely to vary between transactions.\109\ Costs associated with 
collecting requisite Financial Obligation Notice information required 
by proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5) have already been discussed.\110\ 
Therefore, the information collection and reporting costs that remain 
to be accounted for are those not associated with either proposed Rules 
3Cg-1(a)(4) or (5). The Commission preliminarily estimates that to 
gather the information required for purposes of complying with proposed 
Rule 3Cg-1 other than proposed Rules 3Cg-1(a)(4) and (5) would impose 
an ongoing aggregate annual burden of approximately 15,500 burden hours 
for all respondents, which corresponds to a burden of four (4) burden 
hours for each respondent.\111\ These remaining costs are estimated to 
impose an annual cost of approximately $4,600,000 on all respondents 
and an average annual cost of approximately $1,200 per respondent.\112\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \108\ See supra note 80 and accompanying text.
    \109\ See supra note 81.
    \110\ See supra note 99 and accompanying text.
    \111\ See supra note 80 and accompanying text. The estimates 
that follow are based on an assumption that the burden of complying 
with proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5) is equivalent to the burden of 
complying with the requirements of proposed Rule 3Cg-1, not 
including proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(4), given the comparable nature of 
the information required.
    \112\ These monetized costs are calculated as follows: (15 
minutes/60 minutes per hour) x (Compliance Manager at $294 dollars 
per hour) x (62,000 security-based swap transactions annually) = 
$4,557,000 annually; ($4,557,000 dollars annually)/(4,000 
respondents) = $1,139 average annually per respondent. These figures 
do not include the costs associated with complying with proposed 
Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5), which are separately accounted for in note 99 
above and the accompanying text, and the costs associated with 
complying with proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(4), which are separately 
accounted for in note 107 above and the accompanying text.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 80009]]

3. Form of Notice to the Commission
    Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(1)(C) requires that a non-financial 
entity invoking the end-user clearing exception notify the Commission 
how it generally meets its financial obligations and gives the 
Commission discretion to establish how to collect this information. To 
satisfy this requirement, proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) requires entities 
invoking the end-user clearing exception to deliver specified 
information to a registered SDR in the form and manner required for 
delivery of information specified under proposed Rule 901(d) of 
Regulation SBSR.\113\ Under this approach, rather than collecting 
information through a separate process established by the Commission 
for these purposes, the information delivered in compliance with the 
requirements of proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) and proposed Regulation SBSR 
would serve as the notice to the Commission necessary to invoke the 
end-user clearing exception.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \113\ See supra notes 16-20 and accompanying text.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. Benefits
    Since all market participants must already report security-based 
swap transactions to a registered SDR, the Commission preliminarily 
believes that requiring participants invoking the end-user clearing 
exception to report the information required by proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) 
as part of the transaction record should be a reliable and cost-
effective method of collecting the information. Standardized reporting 
through a registered SDR also should increase transparency of the 
market to regulators by providing a full account of all transactions, 
which benefits market participants through increased confidence in the 
reliability and integrity of market transactions and activity. 
Furthermore, standardized reports should allow periodic auditing, which 
should be less costly to regulators than examining on a case-by-case 
basis possibly unstructured financial data submitted by entities 
invoking the exception to perform their regulatory duties.
b. Costs
    Because the form of notice required by proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) would 
use the existing reporting and recordkeeping mechanism for security-
based swap transactions that is required by proposed Rule 901 of 
Regulation SBSR, the Commission preliminarily believes the form of 
notice required by proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) would impose no additional 
burden on persons invoking the end-user clearing exception or SDRs 
other than those described above. The information required to be 
provided to the Commission pursuant to proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a) would be 
transmitted and received electronically and would be stored as part of 
the existing transaction materials that would be required to be 
prepared by proposed Regulation SBSR. The Commission preliminarily 
believes that information collected under proposed Rule 3Cg-1 will not 
be required to be publicly disseminated by the SDR, therefore the 
Commission preliminarily believes there will be no costs associated 
with organizing and posting such information under the requirements for 
public dissemination of information proposed to be met by SDRs.\114\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \114\ See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, supra note 16, 
proposed Rule 902; Regulation SDR Release, supra note 42, proposed 
Rule 13n-4(b)(6).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Total Costs
    In total, the Commission preliminarily estimates that proposed Rule 
3Cg-1 would result in a one-time initial aggregate annualized cost of 
$13,200,000, or $3400 per covered entity \115\ and an ongoing aggregate 
annualized cost of $25,900,000 for all covered entities, or 
approximately $6,500 per covered entity.\116\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \115\ See supra note 105 and accompanying text.
    \116\ These figures are based on the following: ($4,900,000 
associated with proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(5)) + ($16,400,000 to comply 
with proposed Rule 3Cg-1(a)(4)) + ($4,600,000 to comply with other 
notification requirements established by Rule 3Cg-1) = $25,900,000; 
($25,900,000 aggregate annual ongoing costs)/(4000 covered entities) 
= $6,475 per covered entity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Request for Comments

    The Commission requests comment on the costs and benefits of 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1 discussed above, as well as any costs and benefits 
not already described that could result. The Commission also requests 
data to quantify any potential costs and benefits. In addition, the 
Commission requests comment on the following:
    <bullet> What other factors, if any, should the Commission consider 
to estimate the costs and benefits of proposed Rule 3Cg-1?
    <bullet> Is there additional data the Commission should use to 
estimate the costs and benefits of proposed Rule 3Cg-1?
    <bullet> Would proposed Rule 3Cg-1 create additional costs and 
benefits not discussed here?

VII. Consideration of Burden on Competition, and Promotion of 
Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation

    Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, whenever 
it engages in rulemaking and is required to consider or determine 
whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, 
to consider whether the action would promote efficiency, competition, 
and capital formation. In addition to the protection of investors, 
Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when 
making rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact of such 
rules on competition.\117\ Section 23(a)(2) also prohibits the 
Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on 
competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes 
of the Exchange Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \117\ See 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission preliminarily believes that the Rule 3Cg-1 would 
impose limited competitive burdens on counterparties to security-based 
swaps qualifying for the end-user clearing exception and the financial 
markets generally because the overall costs associated with invoking 
the end-user clearing exception are limited. Using the proposed 
reporting structure of Regulation SBSR to satisfy the notice 
requirement necessary to invoke the end-user clearing exception would 
promote efficiency by allowing participants in the security-based swap 
market to use an existing process to accomplish an additional 
legislative requirement. Satisfaction of the notice requirement in this 
way is preliminarily believed by the Commission to promote efficiency 
by allowing participants to fully utilize the capabilities of SDRs 
being established to serve the security-based swaps market specifically 
rather than requiring them to use a separate filing process and data 
repository created for other purposes, such as the Commission's EDGAR 
system, or to establish new infrastructure or business processes to 
meet the statutory notice obligation.
    The end-user clearing exception would be available to non-financial 
entities \118\ that use security-based swaps to hedge or mitigate 
commercial risk, but do not necessarily compete with each other. Such 
counterparties by definition would not transact in

[[Page 80010]]

security-based swaps as their primary business, but rather as part of a 
risk management program related to their other commercial operations. 
Therefore, the Commission preliminarily expects the end-user clearing 
exception to have a neutral effect on competition. In addition, 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1 contains elements noted above intended to limit the 
potential for the end-user clearing exception to be abused, as 
contemplated by Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(6). Features of this kind 
are preliminarily expected by the Commission to limit the potential for 
counterparties that make use of the exception to avoid the mandatory 
clearing requirements to gain an unfair competitive advantage over 
their competitors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \118\ For purposes of the discussion that follows, the term 
``non-financial entities'' includes Identified Financial 
Institutions that would be excluded from the definition of 
``financial entity'' in Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(3) in the event 
the proposed alternative language in Rules 3Cg-1(b) and (c) is 
adopted by the Commission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed Rule 3Cg-1 allows certain non-financial entities who use 
security-based swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk to bypass 
mandatory clearing, and instead engage in non-cleared security-based 
swap transactions even when equivalent products are available for 
clearing by a central counterparty. To the extent that proposed Rule 
3Cg-1 is successful in separating appropriate uses of the end-user 
clearing exception from abusive ones, the proposed rule should help 
economic efficiency and capital formation by not imposing additional 
costs on end-users using security-based swaps to hedge or mitigate 
commercial risk and therefore not contributing to systemic risk in the 
financial system.
    The Commission requests comment on the possible effects of proposed 
Rule 3Cg-1 on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. The 
Commission requests that commenters provide views and supporting 
information regarding any such effects. The Commission notes that such 
effects are difficult to quantify. The Commission seeks comment on 
possible anti-competitive effects of the proposed Rule not already 
identified. The Commission also requests comment regarding the 
competitive effects of pursuing alternative regulatory approaches such 
as requiring notice to be provided through the Commission's EDGAR 
system. In addition, the Commission requests comment on how the other 
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, for which Commission rulemaking is 
required, will interact with and influence the competitive effects of 
the proposed Rule.

VIII. Consideration of Impact on the Economy

    For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness 
Act of 1996 (``SBREFA'') the Commission must advise the OMB whether the 
proposed regulation constitutes a ``major'' rule.\119\ Under SBREFA, a 
rule is considered ``major'' where, if adopted, it results or is likely 
to result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
more (either in the form of an increase or a decrease); (2) a major 
increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or 
(3) significant adverse effect on competition, investment or 
innovation. If a rule is ``major,'' its effectiveness will generally be 
delayed for 60 days pending Congressional review.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \119\ See Public Law 104-121 (March 29, 1996), as amended by 
Public Law 110-28 (May 25, 2007).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission requests comment on the potential impact of proposed 
Rule 3Cg-1, on the economy on an annual basis, on the costs or prices 
for consumers or individual industries, and on competition, investment, 
or innovation. Commenters are requested to provide empirical data and 
other factual support for their view to the extent possible.

IX. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification

    Section 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act \120\ (``RFA'') 
requires federal agencies, in promulgating rules, to make available for 
public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis that 
describes the impact of the proposed rule on small entities. 
Alternatively, section 605(b) of the RFA provides that this analysis 
shall not apply to any proposed rule or proposed rule amendment, if the 
head of the agency certifies that the rule if promulgated will not have 
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \120\ See Public Law 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164 (1980), as amended by 
SBREFA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the RFA, a 
small business includes an issuer or person, other than an investment 
company, that on the last day of its most recent fiscal year had total 
assets of $5 million or less.\121\ Based on input from security-based 
swap market participants and its own information, the Commission 
preliminarily believes that currently there is very little use of 
security-based swaps by non-financial entities that would be eligible 
to use the end-user clearing exception,\122\ and that the non-financial 
entities eligible to invoke the end-user clearing exception and 
transacting in security-based swaps would be corporations, partnerships 
and trusts with assets in excess of $10 million.\123\ On this basis, 
the Commission preliminarily believes that the number of security-based 
swap transactions involving a small entity as that term is defined for 
purposes of the RFA would be de minimis. Moreover, the Commission does 
not believe that any aspect of proposed Rule 3Cg-1 would be likely to 
alter the type of counterparties presently engaging in security-based 
transactions. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that 
proposed Rule 3Cg-1 would have a de minimis impact on small entities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \121\ 17 CFR 230.157. See also 17 CFR 240.0-10(a).
    \122\ See supra note 73 and accompanying text.
    \123\ The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 introduced 
the concept of ``eligible contract participant'' that the Commission 
preliminarily believes is a standard frequently referenced by market 
participants and which may act to limit the ability of non-financial 
entities with assets less than $10 million to transact in security-
based swaps. See Public Law 106-554, 114 Stat. 2763 (Dec. 21, 2000). 
See also Section 1(a)(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''), 7 
U.S.C. 1a(18) as re-designated and amended by Section 721 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act (defining ``eligible contract participant''). The 
Dodd-Frank Act added a definition of eligible contract participant 
to the Exchange Act which references the equivalent definition in 
the CEA, and created new standards to limit the ability of persons 
who are not eligible contract participants to transact in security-
based swaps. See Public Law 111-203, Sec.  761(a) (adding Exchange 
Act Section 3(a)(65)). See also Public Law 111-203, Sec.  761(e) 
(adding Exchange Act Section 6(l)) (making it unlawful for any 
person to effect a transaction in a security-based swap for a person 
that is not an eligible contract participant, unless such 
transaction is conducted on a registered national securities 
exchange).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For the foregoing reasons, the Commission certifies that Rule 3Cg-1
