SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Public Participation

    Interested persons are invited to participate in this rulemaking by 
submitting written data, views, or arguments on all aspects of the 
proposed rule. CBP also invites comments that relate to the economic, 
environmental, or federalism effects that might result from this 
proposed rule. Comments that will provide the most assistance to CBP 
will reference a specific portion of the proposed rule, explain the 
reason for any recommended change, and include data, information, or 
authority that support such recommended change. See ADDRESSES above for 
information on how to submit comments.

Background

    CBP published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal 
Register (73 FR 43385) on July 25, 2008, proposing to amend the CBP 
regulations to establish uniform rules of origin for imported 
merchandise. The proposed rule would extend application of the country 
of origin rules codified in 19 CFR part 102. Those rules have proven to 
be more objective and transparent and provide greater predictability in 
determining the country of origin of imported merchandise than the 
system of case-by-case adjudication they would replace. The proposed 
change also will aid an importer's exercise of reasonable care. In 
addition, the document proposes to amend the country of origin rules 
applicable to pipe fitting and flanges, printed greeting cards, glass 
optical fiber, and rice preparations. Finally, the proposed rule would 
amend the textile regulations set forth in Sec.  102.21 to make 
corrections so that the regulations reflect the language of section 
334(b)(5) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.
    The notice of proposed rulemaking invited the public to comment on 
the proposal. Comments on the proposed

rule were requested on or before September 23, 2008.

Extension of Comment Period

    In response to the proposed rule published in the Federal Register, 
CBP has received correspondence from several parties requesting an 
extension of the comment period. A decision has been made to grant an 
extension of 30 days. Comments are now due on or before October 23, 
2008.
