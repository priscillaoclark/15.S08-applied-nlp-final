Loans in Areas Having Special Flood Hazards; Interagency 
Questions and Answers Regarding Private Flood Insurance

AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC); Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board); Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC); Farm Credit Administration (FCA); and 
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).

ACTION: Notice and request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The OCC, Board, FDIC, FCA, and NCUA (collectively, the 
Agencies) propose to supplement the Interagency Questions and Answers 
Regarding Flood Insurance with new questions and answers regarding the 
acceptance of flood insurance policies issued by private insurers 
pursuant to the Agencies' private flood insurance final rule issued in 
February 2019. These questions and answers will assist lenders in 
meeting their responsibilities under the final rule and increase public 
understanding of the Agencies' respective flood insurance regulations. 
The Agencies solicit comment on all aspects of these new questions and 
answers.

DATES: Comments on the proposed questions and answers must be submitted 
on or before May 17, 2021.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background

    The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 created the National Flood 
Insurance Program (NFIP), which is administered by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\1\ The NFIP enables property owners 
in participating communities to purchase flood insurance if the 
community has adopted floodplain management ordinances and minimum 
standards for new and substantially damaged or improved construction. 
Thus, in participating communities, Federally-backed flood insurance is 
available for property owners in flood risk areas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Public Law 90-448, 82 Stat. 572 (1968).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Congress expanded the NFIP by enacting the Flood Disaster 
Protection Act of 1973 (FDPA).\2\ The FDPA made the purchase of flood 
insurance mandatory in connection with loans made by Federally-
regulated lending institutions when the loans are secured by improved 
real estate or mobile homes located in a special flood hazard area 
(SFHA). The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (the Reform 
Act) (Title V of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory 
Improvement Act of 1994) comprehensively revised the Federal flood 
insurance statutes.\3\ The Reform Act required the OCC, Board, FDIC, 
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and NCUA to revise their flood 
insurance regulations, and required the FCA to promulgate a flood 
insurance regulation for the first time. The OCC, Board, FDIC, OTS, 
FCA, and NCUA \4\ fulfilled these requirements by issuing a joint final 
rule in the summer of 1996.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Public Law 93-234, 87 Stat. 975 (1973).
    \3\ Title V of Public Law 103-325, 108 Stat. 2255 (1994).
    \4\ Throughout this document ``the Agencies'' includes the OTS 
with respect to events that occurred prior to July 21, 2011, but 
does not include OTS with respect to events thereafter. Sections 311 
and 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act transferred OTS's functions to other agencies on July 21, 2011. 
The OTS's supervisory functions relating to Federal savings 
associations were transferred to the OCC, while those relating to 
State savings associations were transferred to the FDIC. See also 76 
FR 39246 (July 6, 2011).
    \5\ 61 FR 45684 (Aug. 29, 1996).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Since 1997, the Interagency Questions and Answers \6\ have provided 
the

[[Page 14698]]

lending industry with guidance addressing a wide spectrum of technical 
flood insurance-related compliance issues. In 2009, the Agencies 
comprehensively revised and reorganized the initial 1997 Interagency 
Questions and Answers. In 2011, the Agencies further finalized two 
additional Q&As that were proposed in 2009.\7\ In October 2013, the 
Agencies jointly issued proposed rules \8\ to implement the escrow, 
force placement, and private flood insurance provisions of the Biggert-
Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (the Biggert-Waters Act).\9\ 
In March 2014, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act (HFIAA) 
was enacted, which, among other things, amended the Biggert-Waters 
Act's requirements regarding the escrow of flood insurance premiums and 
fees and created a new exemption from the mandatory flood insurance 
purchase requirement for certain detached structures.\10\ The Agencies 
finalized the regulations to implement provisions in the Biggert-Waters 
Act and HFIAA under the Agencies' jurisdiction, except for the 
provisions related to private flood insurance, with a final rule issued 
in July 2015.\11\ In February 2019, the Agencies finalized regulations 
that implement the private flood insurance related provisions of the 
Biggert-Waters Act.\12\ This rule requires lenders to accept ``private 
flood insurance,'' as defined in the Biggert-Waters Act (mandatory 
acceptance). In order to assist lenders in evaluating whether a flood 
insurance policy meets the definition of ``private flood insurance,'' 
the private flood insurance rule also includes a compliance aid 
provision. Under the compliance aid provision, a lender may conclude 
that a policy meets the definition of ``private flood insurance,'' 
without further review, if the policy, or an endorsement to the policy, 
contains the compliance aid clause set forth in the rule. Moreover, the 
private flood insurance rule permits a lender, at its discretion, to 
accept a flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer, even if 
the policy does not meet the statutory and regulatory definition of 
``private flood insurance,'' provided the policy meets certain 
requirements in the rule (discretionary acceptance). A lender also is 
permitted, at its discretion, to accept certain mutual aid plans that 
meet the conditions stated in the rule.

in its entirety; ``Q&A'' refers to an individual question and answer

Questions and Answers, please see the preamble to the July 2020 
Proposed Interagency Questions and Answers at 85 FR 40442 (July 6,

    \11\ 80 FR 43216 (July 21, 2015). Subsequently, on November 7,

provisions through a joint notice of proposed rulemaking (81 FR 
78063).
    \12\ 84 FR 4953 (Feb. 20, 2019).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On June 18, 2019, prior to the effective date of the final rule, 
the Agencies hosted a webinar entitled ``Interagency Flood Insurance 
Updates on Private Insurance Rule'' to discuss updates to the Agencies' 
flood regulations concerning acceptance of private flood insurance 
policies.\13\ The Agencies also discussed the private flood insurance 
rule at various flood insurance conferences. Through these activities, 
the Agencies received numerous questions regarding technical compliance 
with this rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

webinar on the private flood insurance rule, including the 
presentation transcripts, see <a href="https://www.consumercomplianceoutlook.org/outlook-live/2019/interagency-flood-insurance-regulation-update/">https://www.consumercomplianceoutlook.org/outlook-live/2019/interagency-flood-insurance-regulation-update/</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On July 6, 2020, the Agencies issued proposed new and revised 
Interagency Questions and Answers (July 2020 Proposed Questions and 
Answers) that covered a broad range of topics related to technical 
flood insurance-related issues, including the escrow of flood insurance 
premiums, the detached structure exemption to the mandatory purchase of 
flood insurance requirement, and force-placement procedures.\14\ The 
July 2020 Proposed Questions and Answers included only two Q&As related 
to private flood insurance because the private flood insurance rule had 
only been in effect since July 2019.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ See 85 FR 40442 (July 6, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As noted in the July 2020 Proposed Questions and Answers, the 
Agencies committed to separately issuing for notice and comment 
proposed questions and answers relating to the private flood insurance 
rule. Accordingly, the Agencies have carefully considered each of the 
many questions received on the private flood insurance rule since its 
issuance, categorized and consolidated the questions, and drafted 24 
private flood insurance questions and answers to be broadly applicable 
to supervised lenders and servicers. The Agencies are now issuing for 
public comment these 24 proposed questions and answers, categorized in 
the three following sections:

I. Private Flood Insurance--Mandatory Acceptance
II. Private Flood Insurance--Discretionary Acceptance
III. Private Flood Insurance--General Compliance

    To assist the reader, the Agencies have included references to 
specific Q&As from the July 2020 Proposed Questions and Answers and 
from other Q&As in this proposal when helpful. In addition, the 
following terms are used throughout this document: ``Act'' refers to 
the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the Flood Disaster 
Protection Act of 1973, as revised by the National Flood Insurance 
Reform Act of 1994, Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 
and Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act (codified at 42 U.S.C. 
4001 et seq). ``Regulation'' refers to each Agency's current rule.\15\ 
Furthermore, the Agencies note that some of the information included in 
certain proposed questions and answers is derived from the preamble of 
the private flood insurance final rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ The Agencies' rules are codified at 12 CFR part 22 (OCC), 
12 CFR part 208 (Board), 12 CFR part 339 (FDIC), 12 CFR part 614 
(FCA), and 12 CFR part 760 (NCUA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Agencies plan to publish a final document in the Federal 
Register that consolidates these proposed private flood insurance 
questions and answers and the July 2020 Proposed Questions and Answers 
into one set of Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Flood 
Insurance.

Public Comments

    The Agencies solicit comment on all aspects of the proposed 
questions and answers regarding the private flood insurance rule. If 
lenders, community groups, or other parties have unanswered questions 
or comments about the private flood insurance provision of the 
Regulation, they are invited to submit them to the Agencies in their 
comments.

Section-by-Section Analysis

I. Private Flood Insurance--Mandatory Acceptance

    The Agencies propose nine new Q&As to address issues regarding the 
mandatory acceptance and the application of the compliance aid 
assurance clause with respect to the private flood insurance provision 
of the Regulation. The new proposed Q&As would be designated as 
Mandatory 1-9. Proposed new Q&A Mandatory 1 would address whether a 
lender may decide to only accept private flood insurance policies under 
the mandatory acceptance provision of the Regulation. The proposed 
answer would confirm that a lender may decide to only accept flood 
insurance policies issued by a private insurer that the lender is 
required to accept because the policies meet the definition of 
``private flood

[[Page 14699]]

insurance'' under the Regulation. The proposed answer also would 
clarify that a lender is not required to accept flood insurance 
policies that only meet the criteria set forth in the discretionary 
acceptance or mutual aid provisions in the Regulation.
    Proposed new Q&A Mandatory 2 would address when a lender must 
review a flood policy issued by a private flood insurer to make sure 
the policy meets the mandatory acceptance criteria, other than at loan 
origination. The proposed response would explain that, other than at 
origination, a lender must review a flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer when the policy is up for renewal, or any time the 
borrower presents the lender with any new flood insurance policy issued 
by a private insurer. The Agencies would clarify that a lender must 
review the policy in these instances in addition to when a triggering 
event occurs (making, increasing, extending or renewing a loan).
    During this review, a lender may determine that the policy meets 
the mandatory acceptance criteria without further review if the policy 
or an endorsement to the policy includes the compliance aid assurance 
clause. However, if the policy does not meet the mandatory acceptance 
criteria, the lender may still accept it if it meets the discretionary 
acceptance criteria or, if applicable, the mutual aid plan criteria. 
The proposed answer would also explain that if the policy does not meet 
any such criteria, the lender must notify the borrower in accordance 
with the force placement provisions of the Regulation. If the borrower 
does not purchase flood insurance that complies with the Regulation, 
the lender must purchase insurance on the borrower's behalf. In 
addition, the Agencies would clarify that a lender may rely on a 
previous review of a flood insurance policy under the discretionary 
acceptance provision, provided there are no changes to the terms of the 
policy. However, as required by the Regulation and discussed below in 
proposed new Q&A Discretionary 4, the lender must document its 
conclusion regarding sufficient protection of the loan in writing. The 
Agencies are also including a reference to proposed new Q&A 
Discretionary 4.
    Proposed new Q&A Mandatory 3 would address whether the private 
flood insurance requirements under the Regulation require a lender to 
change its policy of not originating a mortgage in non-participating 
communities or coastal barrier regions where the NFIP is not available. 
The proposed answer would explain that the Regulation does not require 
a lender to originate a loan that does not meet the lender's 
underwriting criteria. The Agencies would note that the flood insurance 
purchase requirement only applies to loans secured by structures 
located or to be located in an SFHA in which flood insurance is 
available under the Act. As stated in proposed Q&A Applicability 1 in 
the July 2020 Proposed Questions and Answers, the flood insurance 
purchase requirement does not apply within non-participating 
communities where NFIP insurance is not available under the Act. 
Therefore, the proposed answer would state that the lender does not 
need to change its policy of not originating mortgages in areas where 
NFIP insurance is unavailable solely because of the private flood 
insurance requirements under the Regulation.
    Proposed new Q&A Mandatory 4 would address whether the compliance 
aid assurance clause could act as a conformity clause that would make a 
private policy conform to the definition of private flood insurance 
under the Regulation. The Agencies propose to clarify that the 
compliance aid assurance clause is not intended to act as a conformity 
clause but rather to facilitate the ability of lenders and consumers to 
recognize policies that meet the definition of ``private flood 
insurance'' and to promote the consistent acceptance of policies that 
meet this definition.
    Proposed new Q&A Mandatory 5 would provide that a lender is not 
required to accept a flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer 
solely because the policy contains the compliance aid assurance clause 
if the lender chooses to conduct its own review and determines the 
flood insurance policy actually does not meet the mandatory acceptance 
requirements. The proposed answer also would note that if a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private insurer does not include the 
compliance aid assurance clause, the lender must still review the 
policy to determine if it meets the requirements for private flood 
insurance as set forth in the Regulation before the lender may choose 
to reject the policy.
    Proposed new Q&A Mandatory 6 would discuss whether a lender is 
required to conduct an additional review of a flood insurance policy 
under the mandatory acceptance provision if the policy includes the 
compliance aid assurance clause. The proposed answer would state that 
under the mandatory acceptance provision of the Regulation, if a policy 
or an endorsement to the policy contains the compliance aid assurance 
clause, a lender is not required to conduct any further review of the 
policy in order to determine that the policy meets the definition of 
``private flood insurance.'' The Agencies also propose to clarify that 
the language of the compliance aid assurance clause must be stated as 
set forth in the Regulation in order for the lender to rely on the 
protections of the compliance aid assurance clause. However, the 
proposed answer would provide that a lender need not reject a policy 
containing the compliance aid assurance clause if the formatting, font, 
punctuation, and similar stylistic effects that do not change the 
substantive meaning of the clause are different from the compliance aid 
assurance clause set forth in the Regulation. The proposed answer would 
also include a reference to proposed new Q&A Mandatory 7.
    Proposed new Q&A Mandatory 7 would describe additional reviews a 
lender must conduct when a flood insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer includes the compliance aid assurance clause, as the clause 
only assists a lender in making the determination that a flood 
insurance policy meets the definition of private flood insurance in the 
Regulation, and not other requirements specified in the Regulation. 
Specifically, the lender also must ensure that the coverage is at least 
equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the 
designated loan or the maximum limit of coverage available for the 
particular type of property under the Act, and also should ensure that 
other key aspects of the policy are accurate, such as the borrower's 
name and property address. The proposed answer would also include a 
reference to proposed new Q&A Mandatory 6.
    Proposed new Q&A Mandatory 8 would address whether a lender may use 
the criteria under the discretionary acceptance provision to decide 
whether to accept a policy that does not contain the compliance aid 
assurance clause without first reviewing the policy to determine if it 
meets the mandatory acceptance provision. The proposed answer would 
clarify that a lender may first review the policy to determine whether 
it meets the criteria under the discretionary acceptance provision. 
However, if the policy is not accepted under the discretionary 
acceptance provision, the lender would still need to determine whether 
it must accept the policy under the mandatory acceptance criteria. The 
proposed answer would also remind lenders to document that a policy 
provides sufficient protection of the loan if the lender accepts the 
policy under the discretionary acceptance provision of the Regulation.

[[Page 14700]]

    Lastly, new proposed Q&A Mandatory 9 would note that if the 
compliance aid assurance clause is included on the declarations page, a 
lender may accept the policy without further review to determine 
whether the policy meets the definition of private flood insurance. 
However, a lender must also ensure compliance with the mandatory 
purchase requirement.

II. Private Flood Insurance--Discretionary Acceptance

    The Agencies propose to add four new Q&As to provide additional 
clarity on the discretionary acceptance provision of the Regulation. 
These new Q&As would be designated as Discretionary 1-4. Proposed new 
Q&A Discretionary 1 would address whether lenders are required to 
accept flood insurance policies that meet the discretionary acceptance 
criteria. The proposed answer would note that the discretionary 
acceptance criteria in the Regulation set forth the minimum acceptable 
criteria that a flood insurance policy must have for the lender to 
accept the policy under the discretionary acceptance provision. The 
proposed answer would clarify that it is at the lender's discretion to 
accept a policy that meets the discretionary acceptance criteria so 
long as the policy does not meet the mandatory acceptance criteria.
    Proposed new Q&A Discretionary 2 would address the requirements for 
documentation to demonstrate that a policy provides sufficient 
protection of a loan when a lender accepts that policy under the 
discretionary acceptance criteria. The proposed answer would explain 
that the Regulation requires the lender to document its conclusion in 
writing that the policy provides sufficient protection of the loan, 
consistent with safety and soundness principles. In addition, the 
proposed answer would include a reference to proposed Q&A Coverage 1 
from the July 2020 Proposed Questions and Answers, which discusses some 
factors to consider when determining whether a flood insurance policy 
issued by a private insurer provides sufficient protection of the loan, 
consistent with safety and soundness principles.\16\ Furthermore, the 
proposed answer would note that while the Regulation does not require 
any specific documentation to demonstrate that the policy provides 
sufficient protection of the loan, lenders may include any information 
that reasonably supports the lender's conclusion following review of 
the policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ These factors include whether: (1) A policy's deductibles 
are reasonable based on a borrower's financial condition; (2) the 
insurer provides adequate notice of cancellation to the mortgagor 
and the mortgagee; (3) the terms and conditions of the policy with 
respect to payment per occurrence or per loss and aggregate limits 
are adequate to protect the lending institution's interest in the 
collateral; (4) the flood insurance policy complies with applicable 
State insurance laws; and (5) the private insurance company has the 
financial strength, solvency and ability to satisfy claims. See 85 
FR 40442, 40458 (July 6, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed new Q&A Discretionary 3 would address how a lender could 
evaluate concerns related to an insurer's solvency, strength, and 
ability to pay claims in order to determine whether an insurance policy 
provides sufficient protection of a loan, consistent with general 
safety and soundness principles. The proposed answer would provide that 
a lender may evaluate an insurer's solvency, strength, and ability to 
satisfy claims by obtaining information from the State insurance 
regulator's office of the State in which the property securing the loan 
is located, among other options. The proposed answer would further 
indicate that a lender could rely on the licensing or other processes 
used by the State insurance regulator for such an evaluation. The 
proposed answer would also include a reference to proposed Q&A Coverage 
1 from the July 2020 Proposed Questions and Answers.
    Proposed new Q&A Discretionary 4 would address whether a lender is 
required to review a flood insurance policy upon renewal if that policy 
was issued by a private insurer and was originally accepted in 
accordance with the discretionary acceptance requirements. The proposed 
answer would provide that if a lender had accepted a flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer in accordance with the discretionary 
acceptance requirements and the policy is renewed, the lender would be 
required to review the policy upon renewal to ensure that it continues 
to meet the discretionary acceptance requirements. The proposed answer 
would also state that a lender would need to document its conclusion 
regarding sufficiency of the protection of the loan in writing upon 
each renewal to indicate that the policy continues to provide 
sufficient protection of the loan.

III. Private Flood Insurance--General Compliance

    The Agencies propose to add 11 new Q&As on topics related to the 
private flood insurance provisions of the Regulation that are not 
covered in sections I and II above. The new proposed Q&As would be 
designated as Private Flood Compliance 1-11.
    New proposed Q&A Private Flood Compliance 1 would address questions 
on the maximum deductible that a flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer can have for properties located in an SFHA. Under the 
proposed answer, the Agencies would clarify that the analysis would 
depend on whether the lender is accepting the flood insurance policy 
under the mandatory acceptance provision or the discretionary 
acceptance provision.
    Specifically, for a private flood insurance policy that the lender 
is accepting under the mandatory acceptance provision, the proposed 
answer would state that the Regulation provides that the policy must 
contain a deductible that is ``at least as broad as'' the maximum 
deductible in the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) under the 
NFIP, which means that the deductible is no higher than the specified 
maximum under an SFIP for any total coverage amount up to the maximum 
available under the NFIP at the time the policy is provided to the 
lender. The proposed answer would provide that a policy with a coverage 
amount exceeding that available under the NFIP may have a deductible 
exceeding the specific maximum deductible under an SFIP. However, the 
proposed answer would also advise that for safety and soundness 
purposes, the lender should consider whether the deductible is 
reasonable based on the borrower's financial condition, consistent with 
guidance the Agencies proposed in Q&A Amount 9 \17\ in the July 2020 
Proposed Questions and Answers and with how deductibles may be 
evaluated under the discretionary acceptance provision. The proposed 
answer would also set forth examples to aid in compliance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ Proposed Q&A Amount 9, adapted from current Q&A 17, 
provides that a lender should determine the reasonableness of the 
deductible on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the risk 
that such a deductible would pose to the borrower and the lender. 
Proposed Q&A Amount 9 also states that a lender may not allow the 
borrower to use a deductible amount equal to the insurable value of 
the property to avoid the mandatory purchase requirement for flood 
insurance. See 85 FR 40442 at 40463 (July 6, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Agencies note that this proposed guidance regarding the 
deductible for a private flood insurance policy with a coverage amount 
exceeding that available under the NFIP is different from the informal 
advice the Agencies previously provided in supplementary information to 
the private flood insurance rule.\18\ In the supplementary information 
to the private flood insurance rule, the Agencies advised that even for 
private flood insurance

[[Page 14701]]

policies with amounts exceeding the maximum coverage under the NFIP, 
the lender should still match the SFIP deductible for the amount up to 
the maximum coverage amount under the NFIP but could exceed the maximum 
deductible for an SFIP for the coverage over the maximum coverage 
amount available under the NFIP. However, based on additional 
investigation, the Agencies understand that these types of tiered 
deductibles are not common and the guidance provided in the 
supplementary information may not be practicable. Therefore, the 
Agencies believe the guidance they are proposing in Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 1 with respect to deductibles for private flood insurance 
policies accepted under the mandatory acceptance provision will be more 
consistent with private flood insurance policies available in the 
marketplace and safety and soundness standards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ See 84 FR 4953 at 4957 (Feb. 20, 2019).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed Q&A Private Flood Compliance 1 would also provide guidance 
for accepting flood insurance policies issued by private insurers under 
the discretionary acceptance provision. Under the Regulation, the 
policy must provide sufficient protection of the loan, consistent with 
general safety and soundness principles. Proposed Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 1 would note that among the factors a lender could consider 
in determining whether a policy provides sufficient protection of a 
loan is whether the policy's deductible is reasonable based on the 
borrower's financial condition. Therefore, unlike the limitation on 
deductibles for policies accepted under the mandatory acceptance 
provision for any total coverage amount up to the maximum available 
under the NFIP, the proposed answer would provide that a lender can 
accept a flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer under the 
discretionary acceptance provision with a deductible higher than that 
for an SFIP for a similar type of property, provided the lender has 
determined the policy provides sufficient protection of the loan, 
consistent with general safety and soundness principles.
    Proposed Q&A Private Flood Compliance 1 would also include a 
reminder that, consistent with the guidance provided in proposed Q&A 
Amount 9 in the July 2020 Proposed Questions and Answers, a lender may 
not allow the borrower to use a deductible amount equal to the 
insurable value of the property to avoid the mandatory purchase 
requirement for flood insurance. This principle would apply whether the 
lender is evaluating the policy under the mandatory acceptance 
provision or the discretionary acceptance provision.
    The Agencies also received questions on whether a lender may 
require that the deductible of any flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer be lower than the maximum deductible for an NFIP 
policy. New proposed Q&A Private Flood Compliance 2 would clarify that 
a lender may do so under both the mandatory acceptance provision and 
the discretionary acceptance provision. For the mandatory acceptance 
provision, the Regulation requires that the private flood insurance 
policy be at least as broad as an NFIP policy, which includes a 
requirement that the private flood insurance policy contain a 
deductible no higher than the specified maximum deductible for an SFIP. 
Therefore, the proposed answer would clarify that a lender may require 
a borrower's private flood insurance policy deductible be lower than 
the maximum deductible for an NFIP policy in connection with a policy 
that the lender accepts under the mandatory acceptance provision 
consistent with general safety and soundness principles and based on a 
borrower's financial condition, among other factors. With respect to 
the discretionary acceptance provision, the proposed answer would note 
that the lender need only consider whether the policy, including the 
stated deductible, provides sufficient protection of the loan, 
consistent with general safety and soundness principles. The proposed 
answer would also include a reference to proposed Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 1.
    Proposed new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 3 would provide guidance 
regarding whether a lender may charge fees to the borrower for the 
lender's use of a third party to review flood insurance policies. The 
proposed answer would provide that the Act and the Regulation do not 
prohibit lenders from charging fees to borrowers for contracting with a 
third party to review flood insurance policies, with references to Q&A 
Fees 1 and Q&A Fees 2 proposed in the July 2020 Proposed Questions and 
Answers.\19\ The proposed answer would remind lenders that they should 
be aware of any other applicable requirements regarding fees and 
disclosures of fees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ Proposed Q&A Fees 1, adapted from current Q&A 69, lists the 
four instances in the Act and Regulation when a lender or servicer 
can charge the borrower a fee for making a flood determination. 
Proposed Q&A Fees 2, adapted from current Q&A 70, provides that 
charges made for life-of-loan reviews by determination firms may be 
passed to the borrower under certain conditions. See 85 FR 40442 at 
40459-60 (July 6, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 4 addresses the lender's 
responsibility to ensure a flood insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer meets the requirements of the Regulation if the policy is not 
available prior to loan closing. The proposed answer would provide that 
the Act and Regulation do not specify the acceptable types of 
documentation for a lender to rely on when reviewing a flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer. The proposed answer also would 
advise that lenders should determine whether they have sufficient 
evidence to show the policy meets the requirements under the Regulation 
and that if the lender does not have enough information to determine if 
the policy meets the private flood insurance requirements under the 
Regulation, then the lender should timely request additional 
information as necessary to complete its review. The proposed answer 
also would suggest some optional steps that a lender could take to 
mitigate against closing delays.
    The Agencies received many questions requesting guidance on whether 
a declarations page provides sufficient information for a lender to 
determine whether the policy complies with the Regulation. Proposed new 
Q&A Private Flood Compliance 5 would note that the answer depends on 
the information contained in the declarations page. Under the proposed 
answer, if the declarations page provides sufficient information for 
the lender to determine whether the policy meets the mandatory 
acceptance provision or the discretionary acceptance provision of the 
Regulation or if the declarations pages contains the compliance aid 
assurance clause, then the lender may rely on the declarations page. 
However, if the declarations page does not provide sufficient 
information for the lender to determine whether the policy satisfies 
the mandatory acceptance or the discretionary acceptance provision of 
the Regulation, the proposed answer would suggest that the lender 
should request additional information about the policy to aid its 
determination.
    Proposed new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 6 would provide guidance 
on a lender's ability to accept multiple-peril policies. Specifically, 
the proposed answer would clarify that a lender may accept multiple-
peril policies that cover the hazard of flood under the private flood 
insurance provisions of the Regulation, provided they meet the 
requirements of the Regulation.

[[Page 14702]]

    Proposed new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 7 would address the 
question of how the private flood insurance requirements of the 
Regulation would work in conjunction with requirements of secondary 
market investors, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association 
(Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie 
Mac). The proposed answer would first remind lenders that they must 
comply with the Federal flood insurance requirements. The proposed 
answer would then note that secondary market investor requirements are 
separate from the requirements of the Regulation. Therefore, if a 
lender plans to sell loans to such an investor, the proposed answer 
would advise that a lender should carefully review the investor's 
requirements and direct questions regarding these requirements to the 
appropriate entities.
    The Agencies are proposing new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 8 to 
provide guidance to servicers for loans covered by flood insurance 
mandated by the Act. Specifically, the proposed answer would clarify 
that for loans serviced on behalf of lenders supervised by the 
Agencies, the servicer must comply with the Regulation in determining 
whether a flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer must be 
accepted under the mandatory acceptance provision or may be accepted 
under the discretionary acceptance or mutual aid provisions. However, 
for loans serviced on behalf of other entities not supervised by the 
Agencies, the proposed answer would state that the servicer should 
comply with the terms of its contract with such an entity. The proposed 
answer would suggest that when servicing loans on behalf of Fannie Mae 
or Freddie Mac, where there are insurer rating requirements specified 
within those entities' servicing guidance or other relevant authorities 
that are not included in the Regulation, the servicer should adhere to 
those servicing requirements.
    The Agencies also propose to add three new Q&As to provide guidance 
regarding optional methods lenders can use to address questions on 
whether an insurer is licensed, admitted, or otherwise approved to do 
business in a particular State, which is one of the factors lenders 
must evaluate under both the mandatory acceptance and discretionary 
acceptance provisions. Proposed new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 9 
would explain how a lender could determine whether an insurer is 
licensed, admitted, or otherwise approved in a particular State, or 
whether a surplus lines \20\ or nonadmitted alien insurer \21\ is 
permitted to issue an insurance policy in a particular State. The 
proposed answer would suggest that a lender may review the website of 
the State insurance regulator where the collateral property is located 
to determine whether a particular insurer is licensed, admitted, or 
otherwise permitted to issue insurance in a particular State. The 
proposed answer also would advise that a lender could contact the State 
insurance regulator directly. Further, the proposed answer notes that 
the information with respect to surplus lines insurer eligibility may 
be available in the Consumer Insurance Search (CIS) tool available on 
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) website.\22\ 
The proposed answer would state that lenders also may consult 
commercial service providers regarding the eligibility of surplus lines 
insurers in particular States as long as the lenders have a reasonable 
basis to believe that these service providers have reliable 
information. With regard to nonadmitted alien insurers in particular, 
the proposed answer would suggest that lenders could review the NAIC's 
Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) 
notes, ``[t]he surplus lines market (inclusive of U.S. and non-U.S. 
domiciled insurers) is a distinct segment of the industry consisting 
of non-admitted specialized insurers covering risks not available 
within the admitted market . . . Surplus lines insurers are subject 
to regulatory requirements and are overseen for solvency by their 
domiciliary [S]tate or country.'' <a href="https://content.naic.org/cipr_topics/topic_surplus_lines.htm">https://content.naic.org/cipr_topics/topic_surplus_lines.htm</a>. For specific definitions 
related to surplus lines insurers, lenders should review the State 
law in which the property is located.
    \21\ The NAIC notes that ``[w]hereas [S]tates monitor the 
eligibility of U.S. domiciled surplus lines insurers, alien insurers 
eligible to write surplus lines premium are listed on the NAIC 
Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers [<a href="https://www.naic.org/prod_serv_alpha_listing.htm#quarterly_alien">https://www.naic.org/prod_serv_alpha_listing.htm#quarterly_alien</a>] ... [Alien insurers] 
are prohibited from establishing a U.S. branch office.'' <a href="https://content.naic.org/cipr_topics/topic_surplus_lines.htm">https://content.naic.org/cipr_topics/topic_surplus_lines.htm</a>.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 10 would address whether 
lenders may accept policies issued by private insurers that are surplus 
lines insurers for noncommercial residential properties. The proposed 
answer would explain that if the surplus lines insurer is eligible or 
not disapproved to place insurance in the State or jurisdiction in 
which the property to be insured is located, lenders may accept 
policies issued by surplus lines insurers as coverage for noncommercial 
(i.e., residential) properties. In addition, consistent with the Act 
and the Regulation, the proposed answer would confirm that policies 
issued by surplus lines insurers for noncommercial properties are 
covered in the definition of ``private flood insurance'' and in the 
discretionary acceptance provision.\24\ In the definition of ``private 
flood insurance,'' surplus lines policies for noncommercial properties 
are covered as policies that are issued by insurance companies that are 
``otherwise approved to engage in the business of insurance by the 
insurance regulator of the State or jurisdiction in which the property 
to be insured is located.'' The proposed answer also would note that 
within the discretionary acceptance provision, noncommercial 
residential policies issued by surplus lines carriers are covered as 
policies that are issued by private insurance companies that are 
``otherwise approved to engage in the business of insurance by the 
insurance regulator of the State or jurisdiction in which the property 
to be insured is located.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ During discussion of the Biggert-Waters Act on the Senate 
floor, Sen. Crapo noted that surplus lines insurers can provide 
flood insurance coverage for residential properties and asked for 
clarification regarding the inclusion of surplus lines coverage in 
the definition of ``private flood insurance.'' In his response, Sen. 
Johnson stated, ``[T]he definition of `private flood insurance' 
includes private flood insurance provided by a surplus lines insurer 
and is not intended to limit surplus lines eligibility to 
nonresidential properties. While the Senator is correct that surplus 
lines insurance is specifically mentioned in that context, overall 
the definition accommodates private flood insurance from insurers 
who are `licensed, admitted, or otherwise approved' in the State 
where the property is located.'' 158 Cong. Rec. S6051 (daily ed. 
Sept. 10, 2012).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As noted above, if the surplus lines insurer is eligible or not 
disapproved to place insurance in the State or jurisdiction in which a 
property to be insured is located, the surplus lines insurer is deemed 
to be ``otherwise approved to engage in the business of insurance by 
the insurance regulator of the State or jurisdiction in which the 
property to be insured is located'' for purposes of the Act and 
Regulation. Therefore, the proposed answer would note that even if the 
surplus lines insurer is not considered to be engaged in the business 
of insurance under applicable State law, the surplus lines insurer 
nevertheless would meet the criteria only for purposes of this 
provision of the Regulation if the insurer is eligible or not 
disapproved to place insurance in the State or jurisdiction in which a 
property to be insured is located.
    For example, under section 1776 of the California Insurance Code, 
the

[[Page 14703]]

permission granted to allow an insurance policy issued by a nonadmitted 
insurer to be placed in California, ``shall not be deemed or construed 
to authorize any insurer to do business in [California].'' \25\ In 
addition, section 1776 of the California Insurance Code states that 
``[p]lacement activities of a licensed surplus line broker in 
accordance with [California law], including, but not limited to, policy 
issuance, shall not be deemed or construed to be business done by the 
insurer in [California].'' \26\ However, it is the Agencies' 
understanding that these provisions of California law do not make 
ineligible or disapprove any individual surplus lines insurer from 
placing insurance in California if they meet all other applicable 
requirements in California law. Consequently, a surplus lines insurer 
that is eligible or not disapproved to place insurance in California is 
``otherwise approved'' for purposes of the Regulation even though the 
surplus lines insurer is not authorized to do business in California 
for purposes of Section 1776 of the California Insurance Code.

    Proposed new Q&A Private Flood Compliance 11 would address whether 
a lender may accept a private flood insurance policy that includes a 
compliance aid assurance clause, but also includes a disclaimer that 
the ``insurer is not licensed in the State or jurisdiction in which the 
property is located.'' The proposed answer would explain that there are 
circumstances under which lenders may accept a policy issued by an 
insurer that is not licensed in the State or jurisdiction in which the 
property is located. For example, a lender would be able to accept a 
policy issued by a surplus lines insurer recognized or not disapproved 
by the relevant State insurance regulator as protection for loan 
collateral that is a nonresidential commercial property. The proposed 
answer would also provide that a lender may accept a policy issued by a 
surplus lines insurer as protection for loan collateral that includes 
residential property as a policy issued by an insurance company that is 
``otherwise approved to engage in the business of insurance by the 
insurance regulator of the State or jurisdiction in which the property 
to be insured is located.'' The proposed answer would include a cross-
reference to proposed Q&A Private Flood Compliance 10.

Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Private Flood Insurance

I. Private Flood Insurance--Mandatory Acceptance

Mandatory 1. May a lender decide to only accept private flood insurance 
policies under the mandatory acceptance provision of the Regulation?
    Yes. A lender is only required to accept flood insurance policies 
issued by a private insurer that meet the definition of ``private flood 
insurance'' under the Regulation. A lender is not required to accept 
flood insurance policies that only meet the criteria set forth in the 
discretionary acceptance or mutual aid provision of the Regulation.
Mandatory 2. Apart from loan origination, when must a lender review a 
flood policy issued by a private flood insurer?
    Once a flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer comes up 
for renewal or any time the borrower presents the lender with any new 
flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer, regardless of 
whether a triggering event occurred (making, increasing, extending or 
renewing a loan), the lender must review the policy to determine 
whether it meets the mandatory acceptance criteria.\27\ A lender may 
determine that the policy meets the mandatory acceptance criteria 
without further review if the policy or an endorsement to the policy 
includes the compliance aid assurance clause.\28\ If the policy does 
not meet the mandatory acceptance criteria, the lender may still accept 
the policy if it meets the discretionary acceptance criteria or, if 
applicable, the mutual aid plan criteria. If the policy does not meet 
the mandatory acceptance, discretionary acceptance, or mutual aid plan 
criteria, the lender must notify the borrower in accordance with the 
force placement provisions of the Regulation.\29\ If the borrower does 
not purchase flood insurance that complies with the Regulation, the 
lender must purchase insurance on the borrower's behalf.\30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ See 12 CFR 22.3(c)(1) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(3)(i) 
(Board); 12 CFR 339.3(c)(1) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(c)(1) (FCA); and 
12 CFR 760.3(c)(1) (NCUA).
    \28\ 12 CFR 22.3(c)(2) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(3)(ii) (Board); 
12 CFR 339.3(c)(2) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(c)(2) (FCA); and 12 CFR 
760.3(c)(2) (NCUA).
    \29\ 12 CFR 22.7 (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g) (Board); 12 CFR 339.7 
(FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945 (FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7 (NCUA).
    \30\ 12 CFR 22.7(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(g)(1) (Board); 12 CFR 
339.7(a) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4945(a) (FCA); and 12 CFR 760.7(a) 
(NCUA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If the lender has previously reviewed the flood insurance policy 
under the discretionary acceptance provision to ensure that the policy 
meets the private flood insurance requirements of the Regulation, the 
lender may rely on its previous review, provided there are no changes 
to the terms of the policy. However, as required by the Regulation, the 
lender must document its conclusion regarding sufficiency of protection 
of the loan in writing.\31\ See Q&A Discretionary 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ 12 CFR 22.3(c)(3) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(3)(iii) (Board); 
12 CFR 339.3(c)(3) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(c)(3) (FCA); and 12 CFR 
760.3(c)(3) (NCUA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mandatory 3. If a lender has a policy not to originate a mortgage in 
non-participating communities or coastal barrier regions where the NFIP 
is not available, do the private flood insurance requirements under the 
Regulation require a lender to change its policy?
    The Regulation does not require that a lender originate a loan that 
does not meet the lender's underwriting criteria. The Agencies note 
that the flood insurance purchase requirement only applies to loans 
secured by structures located or to be located in an SFHA in which 
flood insurance is available under the Act.\32\ As noted in Q&A 
Applicability 1, the flood insurance purchase requirement does not 
apply within non-participating communities, where NFIP insurance is not 
available under the Act. Therefore, the lender does not need to change 
its policy of not originating mortgages in areas where NFIP insurance 
is unavailable solely because of the private flood insurance 
requirements under the Regulation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \32\ Public Law 93-234, 87 Stat. 975 (1973).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mandatory 4. Did the Agencies intend the compliance aid assurance 
clause to act as a conformity clause that would make a private policy 
conform to the definition of private flood insurance?
    No. The Agencies did not intend the compliance aid assurance clause 
to act as a conformity clause. Rather, the compliance aid assurance 
clause is intended to facilitate the ability of lenders, as well as 
consumers, to recognize policies that meet the definition of ``private 
flood insurance'' and promote the consistent acceptance of policies 
that meet this definition. The compliance aid provision is intended to 
leverage the expertise of insurers to assist lenders in satisfying the 
requirements of the Regulation.

Mandatory 5. Is a lender required to accept a flood insurance policy 
issued by a private insurer that includes the compliance aid assurance 
clause? Conversely, may a lender reject a flood insurance policy issued 
by a private insurer solely because it does not contain the compliance 
aid assurance clause?
    A lender is not required to accept a flood insurance policy issued 
by a private insurer solely because the policy contains the compliance 
aid assurance clause if the lender chooses to conduct its own review 
and determines the flood insurance policy actually does not meet the 
mandatory acceptance requirements.
    If a flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer does not 
include the compliance aid assurance clause, the lender must still 
review the policy to determine if it meets the requirements for private 
flood insurance as set forth in the Regulation before the lender may 
choose to reject the policy.\33\

(NCUA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mandatory 6. If a flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer 
includes the compliance aid assurance clause, does a lender need to 
conduct an additional review of the policy for compliance with the 
mandatory acceptance provision of the Regulation?
    No, under the mandatory acceptance provision of the Regulation, if 
a policy or an endorsement to the policy contains the compliance aid 
assurance clause, further review is not necessary in order for the 
lender to determine that a policy meets the definition of ``private 
flood insurance.'' \34\

760.3(c)(2) (NCUA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is important to note that, in order for the lender to rely on 
the compliance aid assurance clause without further review of the 
policy, the language of the compliance aid assurance clause must be 
stated in the policy, or as an endorsement to the policy, as set forth 
in the Regulation. If the language is different from the compliance aid 
assurance clause set forth in the Regulation, the lender cannot rely on 
the protections of the compliance aid assurance clause in the 
Regulation and should review the policy to determine if it meets the 
definition of private flood insurance. However, a policy containing the 
compliance aid assurance clause need not be rejected if there are 
stylistic differences, such as formatting, font, and punctuation that 
do not change the substantive meaning of the clause, from the 
compliance aid assurance clause included in the Regulation. See also 
Q&A Mandatory 7.
Mandatory 7. What additional reviews does a lender need to conduct if 
the flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer includes the 
compliance aid assurance clause?
    Although a lender may rely on the compliance aid assurance clause 
to determine that a flood insurance policy meets the definition of 
private flood insurance in the Regulation, the lender must also ensure 
that the coverage is at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding 
principal balance of the designated loan, or the maximum limit of 
coverage available for the particular type of property under the 
Act.\35\ The lender should also ensure that other key aspects of the 
policy are accurate, such as the borrower's name and property address.

Mandatory 8. If a flood insurance policy issued by a private issuer 
does not include a compliance aid assurance clause, can a lender use 
the criteria under the discretionary acceptance provision to decide 
whether to accept the policy without first checking to see if the 
policy meets the criteria under the mandatory acceptance provision?
    Yes, the lender may first review the policy to determine whether it 
meets the criteria under the discretionary acceptance provision.\36\ 
However, even if the policy does not meet the discretionary acceptance 
criteria, the lender will still need to determine whether it must 
accept the policy under the mandatory acceptance criteria.\37\

acceptance provision, the Regulation requires the lender to document 
that the policy provides sufficient protection of the loan.\38\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mandatory 9. If the compliance aid assurance clause is on the 
declarations page, may a lender accept the policy without further 
review?
    If the compliance aid assurance clause is included on the 
declarations page, a lender may accept the policy without further 
review to determine whether the policy meets the definition of private 
flood insurance. However, a lender must also ensure compliance with the 
mandatory purchase requirement. See Q&A Mandatory 7.

II. Private Flood Insurance--Discretionary Acceptance

Discretionary 1. Are lenders required to accept flood insurance 
policies that meet the discretionary acceptance criteria?
    No, the discretionary acceptance criteria in the Regulation sets 
forth the minimum acceptable criteria that a flood insurance policy 
must have for the lender to accept the policy under the discretionary 
acceptance provision. It is at the lender's discretion to accept a 
policy that meets the discretionary acceptance criteria so long as the 
policy does not meet the mandatory acceptance criteria.
Discretionary 2. If the lender determines that a flood insurance policy 
meets the discretionary acceptance criteria and accepts that policy, 
what documentation will demonstrate that the policy provides sufficient 
protection of the loan, consistent with general safety and soundness 
principles?
    The Regulation requires the lender to document its conclusion in 
writing that the policy provides sufficient protection of the loan, 
consistent with general safety and soundness principles (see also Q&A 
Coverage 1). While the Regulation does not require any specific 
documentation to demonstrate that the policy provides sufficient 
protection of the loan, lenders may include any information that 
reasonably supports the lender's conclusion following review of the 
policy.
Discretionary 3. How can a lender evaluate the sufficiency of an 
insurer's solvency, strength, and ability to satisfy claims when 
determining whether a flood insurance policy provides sufficient 
protection of the loan, consistent with general safety and soundness 
principles?
    A lender may evaluate an insurer's solvency, strength, and ability 
to satisfy claims by obtaining information from the State insurance 
regulator's office of the State in which the property securing the loan 
is located, among other options. A lender can rely on the licensing or 
other processes used by the State insurance regulator for such an 
evaluation. See Q&A Coverage 1.

[[Page 14705]]

Discretionary 4. If a flood insurance policy issued by a private 
insurer that was originally accepted in accordance with the 
discretionary acceptance requirements is renewed annually, is the 
lender required to review the policy upon renewal?
    If a lender had accepted a flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer in accordance with the discretionary acceptance 
requirements and the policy is renewed, the lender must review the 
policy upon renewal to ensure that it continues to meet the 
discretionary acceptance requirements.\39\ The lender must also 
document its conclusion regarding sufficiency of the protection of the 
loan in writing upon each renewal to indicate that the policy continues 
to provide sufficient protection of the loan.\40\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Private Flood Insurance--Private Flood Compliance

Private Flood Compliance 1. What is the maximum deductible a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private insurer can have for residential 
or commercial properties located in an SFHA?
    The maximum deductible for a flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer varies depending on whether the lender accepts the 
policy under the mandatory acceptance or the discretionary acceptance 
provision. For purposes of compliance with the mandatory acceptance 
provision, the Regulation provides that a policy must contain a 
deductible that is ``at least as broad as'' in a Standard Flood 
Insurance Policy (SFIP)--i.e., no higher than the specified maximum 
under an SFIP--for any total coverage amount up to the maximum 
available under the NFIP at the time the policy is provided to the 
lender.\41\ For a private policy with a coverage amount exceeding that 
available under the NFIP, the deductible may exceed the specific 
maximum deductible under an SFIP. However, for safety and soundness 
purposes, the lender should consider whether the deductible is 
reasonable based on the borrower's financial condition, among other 
factors. See Q&A Amount 9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \41\ 12 CFR 22.2(k) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(b)(9) (Board); 12 CFR 
339.2 (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4925 (FCA); and 12 CFR 760.2 (NCUA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> For example, if a private policy for a commercial building 
provided $1,000,000 of flood insurance coverage, which is in excess of 
the NFIP maximum coverage of $500,000 for a commercial building, then 
it would be acceptable for a million-dollar policy to have a deductible 
higher than the maximum deductible for a policy available under the 
NFIP. The lender should consider whether the deductible is reasonable 
based on the borrower's financial condition.
    <bullet> Similarly, if a private policy for a residential building 
provided $1,000,000 of flood insurance coverage, which is in excess of 
the NFIP maximum coverage of $250,000 for a residential building, then 
it would be acceptable for a million-dollar policy to have a deductible 
higher than the maximum deductible for a policy available under the 
NFIP. The lender should consider whether the deductible is reasonable 
based on the borrower's financial condition.
    For purposes of compliance with the discretionary acceptance 
provision, the Regulation requires that the policy provide sufficient 
protection of the loan, consistent with general safety and soundness 
principles.\42\ Among the factors a lender could consider in 
determining whether a policy provides sufficient protection of a loan 
is whether the policy's deductible is reasonable based on the 
borrower's financial condition. Unlike the limitation on deductibles 
for policies accepted under the mandatory acceptance provision for any 
total coverage amount up to the maximum available under the NFIP, a 
lender can accept a flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer 
under the discretionary acceptance provision with a deductible higher 
than that for an SFIP for a similar type of property, provided the 
lender has determined the policy provides sufficient protection of the 
loan, consistent with general safety and soundness principles.

(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(c)(3)(iv) (NCUA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Whether the lender is evaluating the policy under the mandatory 
acceptance provision or the discretionary acceptance provision, a 
lender may not allow the borrower to use a deductible amount equal to 
the insurable value of the property to avoid the mandatory purchase 
requirement for flood insurance.\43\ See Q&A Amount 9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(NCUA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Private Flood Compliance 2. May a lender require that the deductible of 
any flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer be lower than 
the maximum deductible for an NFIP policy?
    Yes. If the lender is accepting the private flood insurance policy 
under the mandatory acceptance provision, the Regulation requires that 
the private flood insurance policy be at least as broad as an NFIP 
policy, which includes a requirement that the private flood insurance 
policy contain a deductible no higher than the specified maximum 
deductible for a Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP).\44\ The lender 
may require a borrower's private flood insurance policy deductible be 
lower than the maximum deductible for an NFIP policy in connection with 
a policy that the lender accepts under the mandatory acceptance 
provision, consistent with general safety and soundness principles and 
based on a borrower's financial condition, among other factors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Board); 12 CFR 339.2 (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4925 (FCA); and 12 CFR 
760.2 (NCUA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If the lender is accepting a flood insurance policy issued by a 
private insurer under the discretionary acceptance provision, the 
lender need only consider whether the policy, including the stated 
deductible, provides sufficient protection of the loan, consistent with 
general safety and soundness principles.\45\ See also Q&A Private Flood 
Compliance 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \45\ 12 CFR 22.3(c)(3)(iv)(D) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(3)(iii)(D)

(FCA); and 12 CFR 760.3(c)(3)(iv) (NCUA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Private Flood Compliance 3. If a lender utilizes a third party to 
review flood insurance policies, would it be permissible for a lender 
to charge the borrower a fee for this review?
    The Act and the Regulation do not prohibit lenders from charging 
fees to borrowers for contracting with third parties to review flood 
insurance policies. As explained in Q&A Fees 1 and Q&A Fees 2, lenders 
may charge limited, reasonable fees for flood determinations and life-
of-loan monitoring. Similarly, the Act and the Regulation do not 
prohibit lenders from charging a fee to a borrower when a third party 
reviews a flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer. However, 
lenders should be aware of any other applicable requirements regarding 
fees and disclosures of fees.

[[Page 14706]]

Private Flood Compliance 4. If the policy is not available prior to 
closing, what can the lender rely on to make sure the policy meets the 
requirements of the Regulation?
    The Act and Regulation do not specify the acceptable types of 
documentation for a lender to rely on when reviewing a flood insurance 
policy issued by a private insurer. Lenders should determine whether 
they have sufficient evidence to show the policy meets the requirements 
under the Regulation.
    Lenders can take steps to help mitigate against closing delays such 
as designating employees responsible for reviewing flood policies, 
training employees, and requesting additional information from insurers 
early in the process. If the lender does not have enough information to 
determine if the policy meets the private flood insurance requirements 
under the Regulation, then the lender should timely request additional 
information as necessary to complete its review.
Private Flood Compliance 5. Under existing force placement 
requirements, a declarations page is sufficient to evidence a 
borrower's purchase of a flood insurance policy. Does the declarations 
page have sufficient information for a lender to determine whether the 
policy complies with the Regulation?
    It depends. If the declarations page provides enough information 
for the lender to determine whether the policy meets the mandatory 
acceptance provision or discretionary acceptance provision of the 
Regulation or if the declarations pages contains the compliance aid 
assurance clause, then the lender may rely on the declarations pages. 
However, if the declarations page does not provide enough information 
for the lender to determine whether the policy satisfies the mandatory 
acceptance provision or discretionary acceptance provision of the 
Regulation, the lender should request additional information about the 
policy to aid in making its determination.
Private Flood Compliance 6. May a lender accept a multiple-peril policy 
issued by a private insurer to satisfy the mandatory purchase of flood 
insurance requirement?
    Yes. A lender can accept a multiple-peril policy that covers the 
hazard of flood under the private flood insurance provisions of the 
Regulation, provided the policy meets the requirements under the 
Regulation.
Private Flood Compliance 7. How do the private flood insurance 
requirements of the Regulation, especially the compliance aid assurance 
clause, work in conjunction with the requirements from secondary market 
investors (for example, the Federal National Mortgage Association 
(Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie 
Mac))?
    Lenders must comply with Federal flood insurance requirements. The 
requirements for the secondary market are separate from the Regulation. 
A lender should carefully review these separate requirements for 
secondary market investors regarding acceptable private flood insurance 
if the lender plans to sell loans to such investors and should direct 
questions regarding these requirements to the appropriate entities.
Private Flood Compliance 8. When servicing a loan covered by flood 
insurance pursuant to the Act and the Regulation, which requirements 
must a servicer follow in evaluating the acceptance of a flood 
insurance policy issued by a private insurer?
    For loans serviced on behalf of lenders supervised by the Agencies, 
the servicer must comply with the Regulation in determining whether a 
flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer must be accepted 
under the mandatory acceptance provision or may be accepted under the 
discretionary acceptance provision or mutual aid provision. For loans 
serviced on behalf of other entities not supervised by the Agencies, 
the servicer should comply with the terms of its contract with that 
entity. For example, when servicing loans on behalf of Fannie Mae or 
Freddie Mac, where there are insurer rating requirements specified 
within those entities' servicing guidance or other relevant authorities 
that are not required in the Regulation, the servicer should adhere to 
those servicing requirements.
Private Flood Compliance 9. How can a lender determine: (i) Whether an 
insurer is licensed or admitted in a particular State, (ii) or whether 
a surplus lines or nonadmitted alien insurer is permitted to issue an 
insurance policy in a particular State?
    A lender may refer to the website of the State insurance regulator 
where the collateral property is located to determine whether a 
particular insurer is licensed, admitted, or otherwise permitted to 
issue an insurance policy in a particular State. If the lender cannot 
determine this information from the website, the lender could contact 
the State insurance regulator directly. Further, information with 
respect to surplus lines insurer eligibility also may be available in 
the Consumer Insurance Search (CIS) tool available on the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) website. Lenders may 
consult commercial service providers regarding the eligibility of 
surplus lines insurers in particular States provided the lenders have a 
reasonable basis to believe that these service providers have reliable 
information.
    With regard to nonadmitted alien insurers in particular, lenders 
could review the NAIC's Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers.\46\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \46\ See 15 U.S.C. 8204.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Private Flood Compliance 10. May lenders accept policies issued by 
private insurers that are surplus lines insurers for noncommercial 
residential properties?
    Yes, if the surplus lines insurer is eligible or not disapproved to 
place insurance in the State or jurisdiction in which the property to 
be insured is located, lenders may accept policies issued by surplus 
lines insurers as coverage for noncommercial (i.e., residential) 
properties.
    Consistent with the Act and the Regulation, the Agencies confirm 
that policies issued by surplus lines insurers for noncommercial 
properties are covered in the definition of ``private flood insurance'' 
and in the discretionary acceptance provision. In the definition of 
``private flood insurance,'' surplus lines policies for noncommercial 
properties are covered as policies that are issued by insurance 
companies that are ``otherwise approved to engage in the business of 
insurance by the insurance regulator of the State or jurisdiction in 
which the property to be insured is located.'' \47\ Similarly, within 
the discretionary acceptance provision, noncommercial residential 
policies issued by surplus lines carriers are covered as policies that 
are issued by private insurance companies that are ``otherwise approved 
to engage in the business of insurance by the insurance regulator of 
the State or jurisdiction in which the property to be insured is 
located.'' \48\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \47\ See 84 FR 4955-4956 (Feb.20, 2019). See also 12 CFR 
22.2(k)(1)(i) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(b)(9)(i)(A) (Board); 12 CFR 339.2 
(FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4925 (FCA); and 12 CFR 760.2 (NCUA).
    \48\ See 84 FR 4962 (Feb. 20, 2019). See also 12 CFR 
22.3(c)(3)(ii) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.25(c)(3)(iii)(B) (Board); 12 CFR 
339.3(c)(3)(ii) (FDIC); 12 CFR 614.4930(c)(3)(ii) (FCA); and 12 CFR 
760.3(c)(3)(ii) (NCUA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For purposes of the Regulation, the meaning of ``otherwise 
approved'' is

[[Page 14707]]

based on whether applicable State law provides that the surplus lines 
insurer is eligible or not disapproved to place insurance in that 
State. Even if the surplus lines insurer is not considered to be 
engaged in the business of insurance under applicable State law, the 
surplus lines insurer would still be ``otherwise approved'' only for 
purposes of this provision of the Regulation if the insurer is eligible 
or not disapproved to place insurance in the State.
Private Flood Compliance 11. May a lender accept a private flood 
insurance policy that includes a compliance aid assurance clause, but 
also includes a disclaimer explaining that the ``insurer is not 
licensed in the State or jurisdiction in which the property is 
located,'' which suggests that the policy is issued by a surplus lines 
insurer?
    Even if the policy includes a statement indicating that the insurer 
is not licensed in the State or jurisdiction in which the property is 
located, suggesting that the policy is issued by a surplus lines 
insurer, there are circumstances under which lenders may accept the 
policy. A lender may accept a policy issued by a surplus lines insurer 
recognized or not disapproved by the relevant State insurance regulator 
as protection for loan collateral that is a commercial property. Also, 
a lender may accept a policy issued by a surplus lines insurer as 
protection for loan collateral that is a noncommercial property as a 
policy issued by an insurance company that is ``otherwise approved to 
engage in the business of insurance by the insurance regulator of the 
State or jurisdiction in which the property to be insured is located.''
