System (Board); and Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau).

ACTION: Final rules, official interpretations and commentary.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The OCC, the Board, and the Bureau are finalizing amendments 
to the official interpretations for their regulations that implement 
section 129H of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Section 129H of TILA 
establishes special appraisal requirements for ``higher-risk 
mortgages,'' termed ``higher-priced mortgage loans'' or ``HPMLs'' in 
the agencies' regulations. The OCC, the Board, the Bureau, the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union 
Administration (NCUA), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) 
(collectively, the Agencies) jointly issued final rules implementing 
these requirements, effective January 18, 2014. The Agencies' rules 
exempted, among other loan types, transactions of $25,000 or less, and 
required that this loan amount be adjusted annually based on any annual 
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners 
and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If there is no annual percentage increase 
in the CPI-W, the OCC, the Board, and the Bureau will not adjust this 
exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a 
year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold 
is calculated by applying the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W 
to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the 
decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into 
account. Based on the CPI-W in effect as of June 1, 2021, the exemption 
threshold will increase from $27,200 to $28,500, effective January 1, 
2022.

DATES: This final rule is effective January 1, 2022.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 
2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) amended TILA to add special appraisal 
requirements for ``higher-risk mortgages.'' \1\ In January 2013, the 
Agencies jointly issued a final rule implementing these requirements 
and adopted the term ``higher-priced mortgage loan'' (HPML) instead of 
``higher-risk mortgage'' (the January 2013 Final Rule).\2\ In July 
2013, the Agencies proposed additional exemptions from the January 2013 
Final Rule.\3\ In December 2013, the Agencies issued a supplemental 
final rule with additional exemptions from the January 2013 Final Rule 
(the December 2013 Supplemental Final Rule).\4\ Among other exemptions, 
the Agencies adopted an exemption from the new HPML appraisal rules for 
transactions of $25,000 or less, to be adjusted annually for inflation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Public Law 111-203, section 1471, 124 Stat. 1376, 2185-87 
(2010), codified at TILA section 129H, 15 U.S.C. 1639h.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The OCC's, Board's, and Bureau's versions of the January 2013 Final 
Rule and December 2013 Supplemental Final Rule and corresponding 
official interpretations are substantively identical. The FDIC, NCUA, 
and FHFA adopted the Bureau's version of the regulations under the 
January 2013 Final Rule and December 2013 Supplemental Final Rule.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See NCUA: 12 CFR 722.3; FHFA: 12 CFR part 1222. Although the 
FDIC adopted the Bureau's version of the regulation, the FDIC did 
not issue its own regulation containing a cross-reference to the 
Bureau's version. See 78 FR 10368, 10370 (Feb. 13, 2013).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The OCC's, Board's, and Bureau's regulations,\6\ and their 
accompanying interpretations,\7\ provide that the exemption threshold 
for smaller loans will be adjusted effective January 1 of each year 
based on any annual percentage increase in the CPI-W that was in effect 
on the preceding June 1. Any increase in the threshold amount will be 
rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For example, if the annual 
percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the 
threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. 
However, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in 
a $949 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be 
increased by $900. If there is no annual percentage increase in the 
CPI-W, the OCC, the Board, and the Bureau will not adjust the threshold 
amounts from the prior year.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On November 30, 2016, the OCC, the Board, and the Bureau published 
a final rule in the Federal Register to memorialize the calculation 
method used by the Agencies each year to adjust the exemption threshold 
to ensure that the values for the exemption threshold keep pace with 
the CPI-W (HPML Small Dollar Adjustment Calculation Rule).\9\ The HPML 
Small Dollar Adjustment Calculation Rule memorialized the policy that, 
if there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the OCC, Board, 
and Bureau will not adjust the exemption threshold from the prior year. 
The HPML Small Dollar Adjustment Calculation Rule also provided that, 
in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not 
adjusted because there was a decrease in the CPI-W from the previous 
year, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage 
change in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, 
after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the 
CPI-W had been taken into account. If the resulting amount calculated, 
after rounding, is greater than the current threshold, then the 
threshold effective January 1 the following year will increase 
accordingly; if the resulting amount calculated, after rounding, is 
equal to or less than the current threshold, then the threshold 
effective January 1 the following year will not change, but future 
increases will be calculated based on the amount that would have 
resulted, after rounding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See 81 FR 86250 (Nov. 30, 2016).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. 2022 Adjustment and Commentary Revision

    Effective January 1, 2022, the exemption threshold amount is 
increased from $27,200 to $28,500. This amount is based on the CPI-W in 
effect on June 1, 2021, which was reported on May 12, 2021 (based on 
April 2021 data).\10\ The CPI-W is a subset of the CPI-U index (based 
on all urban

[[Page 67845]]

consumers) and represents approximately 29 percent of the U.S. 
population. The CPI-W reported on May 12, 2021, reflects a 4.7 percent 
increase in the CPI-W from April 2020 to April 2021. Accordingly, the 
4.7 percent increase in the CPI-W from April 2020 to April 2021 results 
in an exemption threshold amount of $28,500, after rounding. The OCC, 
the Board, and the Bureau are revising the commentaries to their 
respective regulations to add new comments as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates consumer-based 
indices for each month, but does not report those indices until the 
middle of the following month. As such, the most recently reported 
indices as of June 1, 2021 were reported on May 12, 2021, and 
reflect economic conditions in April 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Comment 203(b)(2)-3.ix to 12 CFR part 34, Appendix C to 
Subpart G (OCC);
    <bullet> Comment 43(b)(2)-3.ix to Supplement I of 12 CFR part 226 
(Board); and
    <bullet> Comment 35(c)(2)(ii)-3.ix to Supplement I of 12 CFR part 
1026 (Bureau).
    These new comments state that, from January 1, 2022, through 
December 31, 2022, the threshold amount is $28,500. These revisions are 
effective January 1, 2022.

III. Regulatory Analysis

Administrative Procedure Act

    Under the Administrative Procedure Act, notice and opportunity for 
public comment are not required if the agency finds that notice and 
public comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest.\11\ The amendments in this rule are technical and 
apply the method previously memorialized in the December 2013 
Supplemental Final Rule and the HPML Small Dollar Adjustment 
Calculation Rule. For these reasons, the OCC, the Board, and the Bureau 
have determined that publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and 
providing opportunity for public comment are unnecessary. Therefore, 
the amendments are adopted in final form.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) does not apply to a rulemaking 
where a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required.\12\ As 
noted previously, the Agencies have determined that it is unnecessary 
to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking for this final rule. 
Accordingly, the RFA's requirements relating to an initial and final 
regulatory flexibility analysis do not apply.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ 5 U.S.C. 603(a), 604(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995,\13\ the 
Agencies reviewed this final rule. No collections of information 
pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act are contained in the final 
rule.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

    The OCC analyzes proposed rules for the factors listed in Section 
202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, before promulgating a 
final rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking was 
published.\14\ As discussed above, the OCC has determined that the 
publication of a general notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary.

* * * * *
    Section 34.203--Appraisals for Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans
* * * * *

Paragraph 34.203(b)(2)

    1. Threshold amount. For purposes of Sec.  34.203(b)(2), the 
threshold amount in effect during a particular period is the amount 
stated in comment 203(b)(2)-3 for that period. The threshold amount 
is adjusted effective January 1 of each year by any annual 
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage 
Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on the 
preceding June 1. Comment 203(b)(2)-3 will be amended to provide the 
threshold amount for the upcoming year after the annual percentage 
change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. 
Any increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest 
$100 increment. For example, if the annual percentage increase in 
the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, 
the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. However, if the 
annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 
increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be 
increased by $900.
    2. No increase in the CPI-W. If the CPI-W in effect on June 1 
does not increase from the CPI-W in effect on June 1 of the previous 
year, the threshold amount effective the following January 1 through 
December 31 will not change from the previous year. When this 
occurs, for the years that follow, the threshold is calculated based 
on the annual percentage change in the CPI-W applied to the dollar 
amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if decreases and 
any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.
    i. Net increases. If the resulting amount calculated, after 
rounding, is greater than the

[[Page 67846]]

current threshold, then the threshold effective January 1 the 
following year will increase accordingly.
    ii. Net decreases. If the resulting amount calculated, after 
rounding, is equal to or less than the current threshold, then the 
threshold effective January 1 the following year will not change, 
but future increases will be calculated based on the amount that 
would have resulted.
    3. Threshold. For purposes of Sec.  34.203(b)(2), the threshold 
amount in effect during a particular period is the amount stated 
below for that period.
    i. From January 18, 2014, through December 31, 2014, the 
threshold amount is $25,000.
    ii. From January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015, the 
threshold amount is $25,500.
    iii. From January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016, the 
threshold amount is $25,500.
    iv. From January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017, the 
threshold amount is $25,500.
    v. From January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018, the 
threshold amount is $26,000.
    vi. From January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019, the 
threshold amount is $26,700.
    vii. From January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, the 
threshold amount is $27,200.
    viii. From January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021, the 
threshold amount is $27,200.
    ix. From January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022, the 
threshold amount is $28,500.
    4. Qualifying for exemption--in general. A transaction is exempt 
under Sec.  34.203(b)(2) if the creditor makes an extension of 
credit at consummation that is equal to or below the threshold 
amount in effect at the time of consummation.
    5. Qualifying for exemption--subsequent changes. A transaction 
does not meet the condition for an exemption under Sec.  
34.203(b)(2) merely because it is used to satisfy and replace an 
existing exempt loan, unless the amount of the new extension of 
credit is equal to or less than the applicable threshold amount. For 
example, assume a closed-end loan that qualified for a Sec.  
34.203(b)(2) exemption at consummation in year one is refinanced in 
year ten and that the new loan amount is greater than the threshold 
amount in effect in year ten. In these circumstances, the creditor 
must comply with all of the applicable requirements of Sec.  34.203 
with respect to the year ten transaction if the original loan is 
satisfied and replaced by the new loan, unless another exemption 
from the requirements of Sec.  34.203 applies. See Sec.  34.203(b) 
and (d)(7).

Paragraph 43(b)(2)

    1. Threshold amount. For purposes of Sec.  226.43(b)(2), the 
threshold amount in effect during a particular period is the amount 
stated in comment 43(b)(2)-3 for that period. The threshold amount 
is adjusted effective January 1 of each year by any annual 
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage 
Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on the 
preceding June 1. Comment 43(b)(2)-3 will be amended to provide the 
threshold amount for the upcoming year after the annual percentage 
change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. 
Any increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest 
$100 increment. For example, if the annual percentage increase in 
the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, 
the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. However, if the 
annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 
increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be 
increased by $900.
    2. No increase in the CPI-W. If the CPI-W in effect on June 1 
does not increase from the CPI-W in effect on June 1 of the previous 
year, the threshold amount effective the following January 1 through 
December 31 will not change from the previous year. When this 
occurs, for the years that follow, the threshold is calculated based 
on the annual percentage change in the CPI-W applied to the dollar 
amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if decreases and 
any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.
    i. Net increases. If the resulting amount calculated, after 
rounding, is greater than the current threshold, then the threshold 
effective January 1 the following year will increase accordingly.
    ii. Net decreases. If the resulting amount calculated, after 
rounding, is equal to or less than the current threshold, then the 
threshold effective January 1 the following year will not change,

preceding June 1. Comment 35(c)(2)(ii)-3 will be amended to provide 
the threshold amount for the upcoming year after the annual 
percentage change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes 
available. Any increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to 
the nearest $100 increment. For example, if the annual percentage 
increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the 
threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. 
However, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result 
in a $949 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount 
will be increased by $900.
    2. No increase in the CPI-W. If the CPI-W in effect on June 1 
does not increase from the CPI-W in effect on June 1 of the previous 
year, the threshold amount effective the following January 1 through 
December 31 will not change from the previous year. When this 
occurs, for the years that follow, the threshold is calculated based 
on the annual percentage change in the CPI-W applied to the dollar 
amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if decreases and 
any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.
    i. Net increases. If the resulting amount calculated, after 
rounding, is greater than the current threshold, then the threshold 
effective January 1 the following year will increase accordingly.
    ii. Net decreases. If the resulting amount calculated, after 
rounding, is equal to or less than the current threshold, then the 
threshold effective January 1 the following year will not change, 
but future increases will be calculated based on the amount that 
would have resulted.
    3. Threshold. For purposes of Sec.  1026.35(c)(2)(ii), the 
threshold amount in effect during a particular period is the amount 
stated below for that period.
    i. From January 18, 2014, through December 31, 2014, the 
threshold amount is $25,000.
    ii. From January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015, the 
threshold amount is $25,500.
    iii. From January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016, the 
threshold amount is $25,500.
    iv. From January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017, the 
threshold amount is $25,500.
    v. From January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018, the 
threshold amount is $26,000.
    vi. From January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019, the 
threshold amount is $26,700.
    vii. From January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, the 
threshold amount is $27,200.
    viii. From January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021, the 
threshold amount is $27,200.
    ix. From January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022, the 
threshold amount is $28,500.
    4. Qualifying for exemption--in general. A transaction is exempt 
under Sec.  1026.35(c)(2)(ii) if the creditor makes an extension of 
credit at consummation that is equal to or below the threshold 
amount in effect at the time of consummation.
    5. Qualifying for exemption--subsequent changes. A transaction 
does not meet the condition for an exemption under Sec.  
1026.35(c)(2)(ii) merely because it is used to satisfy and replace 
an existing exempt loan, unless the amount of the new extension of 
credit is equal to or less than the applicable threshold amount. For 
example, assume a closed-end loan that qualified for a Sec.  
1026.35(c)(2)(ii) exemption at consummation in year one is 
refinanced in year ten and that the new loan amount is greater than 
the threshold amount in effect in year ten. In these circumstances, 
the creditor must comply with all of the applicable requirements of 
Sec.  1026.35(c) with respect to the year ten transaction if the 
original loan is satisfied and replaced by the new loan, unless 
another exemption from the requirements of Sec.  1026.35(c) applies. 
See Sec.  1026.35(c)(2) and (c)(4)(vii).
