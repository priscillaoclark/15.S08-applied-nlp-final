Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); Office of Thrift Supervision, 
Treasury (OTS).

ACTION: Joint final rule; technical amendment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The OCC, the Board, the FDIC, and the OTS (collectively, the 
``agencies'') are amending their Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) 
regulations to adjust the asset-size thresholds used to define ``small 
bank'' or ``small savings association'' and ``intermediate small bank'' 
or ``intermediate small savings association.'' As required by the CRA 
regulations, the adjustment to the threshold amount is based on the 
annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index.

DATES: Effective Date: January 1, 2010.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background and Description of the Joint Final Rule

    The agencies' CRA regulations establish CRA performance standards 
for small and intermediate small banks and savings associations. The 
regulations define small and intermediate small institutions by 
reference to asset-size criteria expressed in dollar amounts, and they 
further require the agencies to publish annual adjustments to these 
dollar figures based on the year-to-year change in the average of the 
Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers 
(CPIW), not seasonally adjusted, for each twelve-month period ending in 
November, with rounding to the nearest million. 12 CFR 25.12(u)(2), 
228.12(u)(2), 345.12(u)(2), and 563e.12(u)(2).
    The threshold for small banks and small savings associations was 
revised most recently effective January 1, 2009 (73 FR 78153 (Dec. 22, 
2008)). The CRA regulations, as revised on December 22, 2008, provide 
that banks and savings associations that, as of December 31 of either 
of the prior two calendar years, had assets of less than $1.109 billion 
are ``small banks'' or ``small savings associations.'' Small banks and 
small savings associations with assets of at least $277 million as of 
December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years and less than 
$1.109 billion as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar 
years are ``intermediate small banks'' or ``intermediate small savings 
associations.'' 12 CFR 25.12(u)(1), 228.12(u)(1), 345.12(u)(1), 
563e.12(u)(1). This joint final rule further revises these thresholds.

[[Page 68663]]

    During the period ending November 2009, the CPIW decreased by 0.98 
percent. As a result, the agencies are revising 12 CFR 25.12(u)(1), 
228.12(u)(1), 345.12(u)(1), and 563e.12(u)(1) to make this annual 
adjustment. Beginning January 1, 2010, banks and savings associations 
that, as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years, had 
assets of less than $1.098 billion are ``small banks'' or ``small 
savings associations.'' Small banks or small savings associations with 
assets of at least $274 million as of December 31 of both of the prior 
two calendar years and less than $1.098 billion as of December 31 of 
either of the prior two calendar years are ``intermediate small banks'' 
or ``intermediate small savings associations.'' The agencies also 
publish current and historical asset-size thresholds on the Web site of 
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.ffiec.gov/cra/">http://
www.ffiec.gov/cra/</A>.

Administrative Procedure Act and Effective Date

    Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 
an agency may, for good cause, find (and incorporate the finding and a 
brief statement of reasons therefore in the rules issued) that notice 
and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or 
contrary to the public interest.
    The amendments to the regulations to adjust the asset-size 
thresholds for small and intermediate small banks and savings 
associations result from the application of a formula established by a 
provision in the CRA regulations that the agencies previously published 
for comment. See 70 FR 12148 (Mar. 11, 2005), 70 FR 44256 (Aug. 2, 
2005), 71 FR 67826 (Nov. 24, 2006), and 72 FR 13429 (Mar. 22, 2007). 
Sections 25.12(u)(1), 228.12(u)(1), 345.12(u)(1), and 563e.12(u)(1) are 
amended by adjusting the asset-size thresholds as provided for in 
Sec. Sec.  25.12(u)(2), 228.12(u)(2), 345.12(u)(2), and 563e.12(u)(2).
    Accordingly, since the agencies' rules provide no discretion as to 
the computation or timing of the revisions to the asset-size criteria, 
the agencies have determined that publishing a notice of proposed 
rulemaking and providing opportunity for public comment are 
unnecessary.
    The effective date of this joint final rule is January 1, 2010. 
Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the APA, the required publication or 
service of a substantive rule shall be made not less than 30 days 
before its effective date, except, among other things, as provided by 
the agency for good cause found and published with the rule. Because 
this rule adjusts asset-size thresholds consistent with the procedural 
requirements of the CRA rules, the agencies conclude that it is not 
substantive within the meaning of the APA's delayed effective date 
provision. Moreover, the agencies find that there is good cause for 
dispensing with the delayed effective date requirement, even if it 
applied, because their current rules already provide notice that the 
small and intermediate asset-size thresholds will be adjusted as of 
December 31 based on twelve-month data as of the end of November each 
year.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) does not apply to a rulemaking 
where a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required. 5 U.S.C. 
603 and 604. As noted previously, the agencies have determined that it 
is unnecessary to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking for 
this joint final rule. Accordingly, the RFA's requirements relating to 
an initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis do not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
Ch. 3506; 5 CFR part 1320), the agencies reviewed this final rule. No 
collections of information pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act are 
contained in the final rule.

Executive Order 12866

    The OCC and OTS have each determined that its portion of this joint 
final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
Executive Order 12866.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995

    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 
1532 (Unfunded Mandates Act), requires that an agency must prepare a 
budgetary impact statement before promulgating any final rule for which 
a general notice of proposed rulemaking was published. As discussed 
above, the agencies have determined that the publication of a general 
notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary. Accordingly, this joint 
final rule is not subject to section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Act.

Executive Order 13132

    The OCC and OTS have each determined that its portion of this joint 
final rule does not have any Federalism implications as required by 
Executive Order 13132.
