SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Policy Objectives

    The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA) requires Federal 
agencies to collect debts owed to the United States in accordance with 
regulations that either adopt, or at least are consistent with, 
standards prescribed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department 
of the Treasury (Treasury).\1\ Treasury has issued regulations 
applicable to collection under the DCIA, and these regulations, known 
as the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS), became effective on 
December 22, 2000. The purpose of the DCIA is to enhance the efficiency 
and effectiveness of the Federal Government's efforts to collect debt 
owed to the United States. A principal feature of the DCIA was the 
creation of the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), a Government-wide 
database of delinquent debtors that offsets (reduces) Federal payments 
to recipients who also owe delinquent debt to the United States and 
that remits the offset amount to the creditor agency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See Public Law 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321-358 (codified at 31 
U.S.C. 3701 et seq.).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FDIC is amending its regulations, in accordance with the DCIA, 
to add the collection of civil money penalty (CMP) debt to the FDIC's 
existing debt-collection regulations found in 12 CFR part 313. Part 313 
does not currently provide for collection of CMP debt. The amendments 
would allow the FDIC to refer debts arising from its enforcement-
related activities to Treasury for collection, thereby improving the 
effectiveness of the FDIC's debt-collection efforts.

II. Background

    In 2002, the FDIC, in compliance with the DCIA, promulgated 12 CFR 
part 313

[[Page 1741]]

governing the collection of certain debts owed to the FDIC in its 
corporate capacity by Federal employees, including FDIC employees, and 
certain third parties.\2\ The FDIC amended part 313 in 2006 to include 
criminal restitution debt.\3\ Part 313, in its present form, applies 
only to debts owed to and payments made by the FDIC acting in its 
corporate capacity, and criminal restitution debt owed to the FDIC in 
either its corporate capacity or its receivership capacity.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See 67 FR 48525 (July 25, 2002).
    \3\ 71 FR 75659 (Dec. 18, 2006).
    \4\ 12 CFR 313.1(c)(1)-(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The DCIA authorizes the FDIC to collect delinquent CMP debts that 
arise from its supervision and enforcement functions,\5\ but the 
current part 313 does not apply--aside from criminal restitution debt 
noted above--to ``debts owed to or payments made by the FDIC in 
connection with the FDIC's liquidation, supervision, enforcement, or 
insurance responsibilities.'' \6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ The FDIC assesses CMPs under the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Act, 12 U.S.C. 1818(i), and a variety of other statutes. See, e.g., 
12 U.S.C. 1972(2)(F) (authorizing the FDIC to impose CMPs for 
violations of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1970 related to 
prohibited tying arrangements); 15 U.S.C. 78u-2 (authorizing the 
FDIC to impose CMPs for violations of certain provisions of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934); and 42 U.S.C. 4012a(f) 
(authorizing the FDIC to impose CMPs for pattern or practice 
violations of the Flood Disaster Protection Act).
    \6\ 12 CFR 313.1(c)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Discussion of the Amendments to Part 313

    The rule amends FDIC regulations to provide for the collection of 
CMP debt. It will do so by adopting existing Treasury regulations 
concerning debt-collection procedures as to the collection of CMP debt. 
It will improve the effectiveness of the FDIC's debt-collection 
efforts, primarily by allowing the FDIC to refer debts arising from its 
enforcement-related activities to Treasury for collection. The rule 
will not affect the FDIC's existing authority under part 313 to collect 
other forms of debt, including debt owed to the FDIC in its corporate 
capacity or for the collection of criminal restitution debt.
    The legal authority for the amendments is found, in part, in the 
DCIA itself. The DCIA's definition of ``debt'' includes ``any amount of 
funds or property that has been determined by an appropriate official 
of the Federal Government to be owed to the United States by a person, 
organization or entity other than another Federal agency.'' \7\ The 
FDIC is amending part 313 in accordance with the FDIC's authority under 
12 U.S.C. 1819(a) to prescribe rules and regulations governing its 
operations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 37 U.S.C. 3701(b)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Accordingly, the FDIC is amending part 313 as follows:
    Section 313.1 (Scope) is revised to include CMP debt in part 313. 
This section also notes that subparts B through G of part 313 do not 
apply to the collection of CMP debt.
    Section 313.3 (Definitions) is amended to include CMP debtors among 
the list of debtors, under paragraph (u), to whom a creditor agency 
(the FDIC) may send a written notice that, among other statements, 
claims a debt and informs the debtor that the creditor agency intends 
to collect the debt by administrative offset. The rule makes a 
technical revision to paragraph (d) to substitute ``the Bureau of the 
Fiscal Service'' as the successor Treasury entity to ``FMS'' 
(Treasury's former Financial Management Service) and to note that the 
FDIC has the statutory authority, under 12 U.S.C. 1818(i)(2)(F), to 
compromise, modify, or remit any CMP that the FDIC may assess or has 
already assessed under 12 U.S.C. 1818(i)(2)(A)-(C). Section 313.3 is 
also revised at paragraphs (j), (m), (n), and (q) to include three 
divisions of the FDIC, as well as the directors of those divisions (or 
their designees), since the enforcement and supervisory activities of 
those divisions may result in the assessment of CMPs.
    Section 313.4 (Delegations of authority) contains technical 
amendments to clarify the following delegations: (1) Authority to 
collect debt, other than criminal restitution debt and CMP debt, on 
behalf of the FDIC in its corporate capacity is delegated to the 
Director of the Division of Administration or Director of the Division 
of Finance, as applicable, or to the applicable Director's designee; 
and (2) authority to collect criminal restitution debt on behalf of the 
FDIC in either its receivership or corporate capacity is delegated to 
the Director of the Division of Resolutions and Receiverships, or to 
her or his designee.
    The rule creates a new part 313, subpart H, which concerns the 
collection of CMP debt. Section 313.181 (Scope) states that subpart H 
establishes FDIC procedures for the collection of CMP debt. Section 
313.182 (Purpose) notes that the purpose of subpart H is to implement 
Federal statutes and regulatory standards authorizing the FDIC to 
collect delinquent CMPs. Section 313.183 (Definitions) indicates that 
the definitions provided at section 313.3 apply to subpart H to the 
extent they are applicable.
    Section 313.184 outlines how the FDIC will collect CMP debt. 
Paragraph (a) states that the FDIC will follow Treasury regulations set 
forth at 31 CFR part 285, as applicable and consistent with subpart H, 
for the collection of CMP debt, including centralized offset of Federal 
payments to collect non-tax debts that may be owed to the FDIC. 
Paragraph (b) notes that nothing in subpart H shall be construed to 
require the FDIC to provide duplicate notice or other procedural 
protections that have already been provided or afforded to a CMP debtor 
in the course of administrative or judicial litigation or otherwise. 
Paragraph (c) says that, for CMP debtors, and for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 
3716(b)(1), the FDIC adopts without change the regulations on 
collection by administrative offset set forth at 31 CFR 901.3 and other 
relevant sections of the FCCS applicable to such offset, to the extent 
those regulations are consistent with subpart H. Finally, paragraph (d) 
states that nothing in subpart H precludes the collection of debts 
through any other available means or precludes the FDIC from engaging 
in litigation or the compromise of debt as provided under 12 U.S.C. 
1818(i) or any other applicable law or regulation.

IV. Expected Effects

    The FDIC is amending part 313 in accordance with the FDIC's 
authority under 12 U.S.C. 1819(a) to prescribe rules and regulations 
governing its operations. The rule would not directly affect any FDIC-
supervised institutions. The rule could indirectly affect FDIC-insured 
instructions and individuals who are delinquent with respect to CMPs 
that have been assessed against them by the FDIC. According to the 
FDIC's information, the sum of delinquent CMPs owed to the FDIC amounts 
to approximately $1 million. The delinquent CMP funds represent a 
preexisting obligation owed by the individuals or institutions; 
therefore, the rule will have no effect on these obligations. However, 
the rule, as amended, could increase the portion of these obligations 
that is ultimately collected under part 313.

V. Alternatives Considered

    As discussed previously, part 313 does not currently apply to the 
collection of delinquent CMPs. The FDIC believes that it can increase 
the effectiveness of its delinquent CMP collection efforts through the 
use of administrative offset. The DCIA states that agencies, before 
collecting a claim by administrative offset, must either adopt the FCCS 
without change or prescribe agency regulations for collecting debts by 
administrative offset that are consistent with the FCCS. The

[[Page 1742]]

FDIC has considered these two approaches and has decided to adopt the 
FCCS without change for the collection of delinquent CMPs.

VI. Administrative Law Matters

A. Administrative Procedure Act

    The FDIC is issuing this final rule without prior notice and the 
opportunity for public comment ordinarily prescribed by the 
Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\8\ Pursuant to section 553(b)(A) of 
the APA, general notice and the opportunity for public comment are not 
required with respect to a rule of ``agency organization, procedure, or 
practice.'' \9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 5 U.S.C. 553.
    \9\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As discussed above, this final rule amends the FDIC regulations to 
provide for the collection of CMP debt. It will do so by adopting 
existing Treasury regulations concerning debt-collection procedures as 
to the collection of CMP debt. These amendments relate solely to agency 
procedure and practice. For this reason, the FDIC finds that general 
notice and opportunity for public comment are not required under the 
APA.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) \10\ requires an agency to 
consider whether the rules it proposes will have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities.\11\ The RFA applies 
only to rules for which an agency publishes a general notice of 
proposed rulemaking pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b). As discussed 
previously, consistent with section 553(b)(A) of the APA, the FDIC has 
determined that general notice and opportunity for public comment is 
not required as the final rule is a rule of agency procedure and 
practice. Accordingly, the FDIC has concluded that the RFA's 
requirements relating to initial and final regulatory flexibility 
analysis do not apply.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
    \11\ Under regulations issued by the Small Business 
Administration, a small entity includes a depository institution, 
bank holding company, or savings and loan holding company with total 
assets of $600 million or less and trust companies with total assets 
of $41.5 million or less. See 13 CFR 121.201.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (PRA),\12\ the FDIC may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection 
unless it displays a currently-valid Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) control number. The final rule does not create new or modify 
existing information collection requirements. Accordingly, no 
submission to OMB will be made with respect to the final rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994

    Pursuant to section 302(a) of the Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act (RCDRIA),\13\ in determining the effective 
date and administrative compliance requirements for new regulations 
that impose additional reporting, disclosure, or other requirements on 
insured depository institutions (IDIs), each Federal banking agency 
must consider, consistent with principles of safety and soundness and 
the public interest, any administrative burdens that such regulations 
would place on depository institutions, including small depository 
institutions, and customers of depository institutions, as well as the 
benefits of such regulations. In addition, section 302(b) of RCDRIA 
requires new regulations and amendments to regulations that impose 
additional reporting, disclosures, or other new requirements on IDIs 
generally to take effect on the first day of a calendar quarter that 
begins on or after the date on which the regulations are published in 
final form.\14\ Because the final rule does not impose any reporting, 
disclosure, or other new requirements on insured depository 
institutions, the requirements of RCDRIA do not apply.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ 12 U.S.C. 4802(a).
    \14\ Id. at 4802(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. Congressional Review Act

    For purposes of the Congressional Review Act (CRA), OMB makes a 
determination as to whether a final rule constitutes a ``major'' 
rule.\15\ If a rule is deemed a ``major rule'' by the OMB, the CRA 
generally provides that the rule may not take effect until at least 60 
days following its publication.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The CRA defines a ``major rule'' as any rule that the Administrator 
of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the OMB finds 
has resulted in or is likely to result in (1) an annual effect on the 
economy of $100,000,000 or more; (2) a major increase in costs or 
prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local 
government agencies or geographic regions, or (3) significant adverse 
effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, 
innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to 
compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic and export 
markets.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ 5 U.S.C. 804(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The OMB has determined that this final rule is not a major rule for 
purposes of the CRA. As required by the CRA, the FDIC will submit the 
final rule and other appropriate reports to Congress and the Government 
Accountability Office for review.

F. Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act \17\ requires each 
Federal banking agency to use plain language in all of its proposed and 
final rules published after January 1, 2000. The FDIC has sought to 
present the final rule in a simple and straightforward manner.

Sec.  313.3   Definitions.

    Except where the context clearly indicates otherwise or where the

decision by a hearing official or administrative law judge constitutes 
a certification.
    (e) Chairman means the Chairman of the FDIC.

the United States from fees, leases, rents, royalties, services, sales 
of real or personal property, overpayments, penalties, damages, 
interest, restitution, fines and forfeitures, and all other similar 
sources. For purposes of this part, a debt owed to the FDIC constitutes 
a debt owed to the United States.
    (i) Debt collection center means the Department of the Treasury or 
other Government agency or division designated by the Secretary of the 
Treasury with authority to collect debts on behalf of creditor agencies 
in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(g).

the Division of Complex Institution Supervision and Resolution (CISR), 
as applicable, or the applicable Director's designee.
    (k) Disposable pay means that part of current adjusted basic pay, 
special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, and, in the case 
of an employee not entitled to adjusted basic pay, other authorized 
pay, remaining for each pay period after the deduction of any amount 
required by law to be withheld. The FDIC shall allow the following 
deductions in determining the amount of disposable pay that is subject 
to salary offset:
    (1) Federal employment taxes;
    (2) Federal, state, or local income taxes to the extent authorized 
or required by law, but no greater than would be the case if the 
employee claimed all dependents to which he or she is entitled and such 
additional amounts for which the employee presents evidence of a tax 
obligation supporting the additional withholding;

[[Page 1744]]

    (3) Medicare deductions;
    (4) Health insurance premiums;
    (5) Normal retirement contributions, including employee
