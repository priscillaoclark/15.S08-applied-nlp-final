FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

12 CFR Part 204

[Docket No. R-1753]
RIN 7100-AG17


Regulation D: Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions

AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(``Board'') is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of 
Depository Institutions to revise the rate of interest paid on balances 
maintained to satisfy reserve balance requirements (``IORR'') and the 
rate of interest paid on excess balances (``IOER'') maintained at 
Federal Reserve Banks by or on behalf of eligible institutions. The 
final amendments specify that IORR is 0.15 percent and IOER is 0.15 
percent, a 0.05 percentage point increase from their prior levels. The 
amendments are intended to enhance the role of IORR and IOER in 
maintaining the Federal funds rate in the target range established by 
the Federal Open Market Committee (``FOMC'' or ``Committee'').

[[Page 38906]]


DATES: 
    Effective date: The amendments to part 204 (Regulation D) are 
effective July 23, 2021.
    Applicability date: The IORR and IOER rate changes were applicable 
on June 17, 2021.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Statutory and Regulatory Background

    For monetary policy purposes, section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act 
(``Act'') imposes reserve requirements on certain types of deposits and 
other liabilities of depository institutions.\1\ Regulation D, which 
implements section 19 of the Act, requires that a depository 
institution meet reserve requirements by holding cash in its vault, or 
if vault cash is insufficient, by maintaining a balance in an account 
at a Federal Reserve Bank (``Reserve Bank'').\2\ Section 19 also 
provides that balances maintained by or on behalf of certain 
institutions in an account at a Reserve Bank may receive earnings to be 
paid by the Reserve Bank at least once each quarter, at a rate or rates 
not to exceed the general level of short-term interest rates.\3\ 
Institutions that are eligible to receive earnings on their balances 
held at Reserve Banks (``eligible institutions'') include depository 
institutions and certain other institutions.\4\ Section 19 also 
provides that the Board may prescribe regulations concerning the 
payment of earnings on balances at a Reserve Bank.\5\ Prior to these 
amendments, Regulation D specified a rate of 0.10 percent for both IORR 
and IOER.\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Amendments to IORR and IOER

    The Board is amending Sec.  204.10(b)(5) of Regulation D to specify 
that IORR is 0.15 percent and IOER is 0.15 percent. The amendments 
represent a 0.05 percentage point increase in IORR and IOER. This 
decision was announced on June 16, 2021, with an effective date of June 
17, 2021, in the Federal Reserve Implementation Note that accompanied 
the FOMC's statement on June 16, 2021. The FOMC statement stated that 
the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 0 to \1/4\ percent.
    A Federal Reserve Implementation note stated:

    The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted 
unanimously to set the interest rate paid on required and excess 
reserve balances at 0.15 percent, effective June 17, 2021 Setting 
the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 15 
basis points above the bottom of the target range for the federal 
funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market 
at rates well within the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range and to support the smooth functioning of short-term funding 
markets.

    As a result, the Board is amending Sec.  204.10(b)(5) of Regulation 
D to change IORR to 0.15 percent and IOER to 0.15 percent.

III. Administrative Procedure Act

    In general, the Administrative Procedure Act (``APA'') \7\ imposes 
three principal requirements when an agency promulgates legislative 
rules (rules made pursuant to Congressionally-delegated authority): (1) 
Publication with adequate notice of a proposed rule; (2) followed by a 
meaningful opportunity for the public to comment on the rule's content; 
and (3) publication of the final rule not less than 30 days before its 
effective date. The APA provides that notice and comment procedures do 
not apply if the agency for good cause finds them to be ``unnecessary, 
impracticable, or contrary to the public interest.'' \8\ Section 553(d) 
of the APA also provides that publication at least 30 days prior to a 
rule's effective date is not required for (1) a substantive rule which 
grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction; (2) 
interpretive rules and statements of policy; or (3) a rule for which 
the agency finds good cause for shortened notice and publishes its 
reasoning with the rule.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.
    \8\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A).
    \9\ 5 U.S.C. 553(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Board has determined that good cause exists for finding that 
the notice, public comment, and delayed effective date provisions of 
the APA are unnecessary, impracticable, or contrary to the public 
interest with respect to these final amendments to Regulation D. The 
rate changes for IORR and IOER that are reflected in the final 
amendments to Regulation D were made with a view towards accommodating 
commerce and business and with regard to their bearing upon the general 
credit situation of the country. Notice and public comment would 
prevent the Board's action from being effective as promptly as 
necessary in the public interest and would not otherwise serve any 
useful purpose. Notice, public comment, and a delayed effective date 
would create uncertainty about the finality and effectiveness of the 
Board's action and undermine the effectiveness of that action. 
Accordingly, the Board has determined that good cause exists to 
dispense with the notice, public comment, and delayed effective date 
procedures of the APA with respect to these final amendments to 
Regulation D.

IV. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA'') does not apply to a 
rulemaking where a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not 
required.\10\ As noted previously, the Board has determined that it is 
unnecessary and contrary to the public interest to publish a general 
notice of proposed rulemaking for this final rule. Accordingly, the 
RFA's requirements relating to an initial and final regulatory 
flexibility analysis do not apply.

V. Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (``PRA'') of 
1995,\11\ the Board reviewed the final rule under the authority 
delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and Budget. The 
final rule contains no requirements subject to the PRA.
