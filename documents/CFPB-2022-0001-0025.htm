SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Question Presented

    Can entities violate the prohibition on unfair acts or practices in 
the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) when they have 
insufficient data protection or information security?

Response

    Yes. In addition to other Federal laws governing data security for 
financial institutions, including the Safeguards Rules issued under the 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), ``covered persons'' and ``service 
providers'' must comply with the prohibition on unfair acts or 
practices in the CFPA. Inadequate security for the sensitive consumer 
information collected, processed, maintained, or stored by the company 
can constitute an unfair practice in violation of 12 U.S.C. 
5536(a)(1)(B). While these requirements often overlap, they are not 
coextensive.
    Acts or practices are unfair when they cause or are likely to cause 
substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by 
countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Inadequate 
authentication, password management, or software update policies or 
practices are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is 
not reasonably avoidable by consumers, and financial institutions are 
unlikely to successfully justify weak data security practices based on 
countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Inadequate data 
security can be an unfair practice in the absence of a breach or 
intrusion.

Analysis

    Widespread data breaches and cyberattacks have resulted in 
significant harms to consumers, including monetary loss, identity 
theft, significant time and money spent dealing with the impacts of the 
breach, and other forms of financial distress. Providers of consumer 
financial services are subject to specific requirements to protect 
consumer data. In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) updated its 
Safeguards Rule implementing section 501(b) of GLBA, to set forth 
specific criteria relating to the safeguards that certain nonbank 
financial institutions must implement as a part of their information 
security programs.\1\ These safeguards, among other things, limit who 
can access customer information, require the use of encryption to 
secure such information, and require the designation of a single 
qualified individual to oversee an institution's information security 
program and report at least annually to the institution's board of 
directors or equivalent governing body. The Federal banking agencies 
also have issued interagency guidelines to implement section 501 of 
GLBA.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 86 FR 70272 (Dec. 9, 2021).
    \2\ See 66 FR 8616 (Feb. 1, 2001). These guidelines are 
currently codified at 12 CFR pt. 30, appendix B (OCC); Regulation H, 
12 CFR 208, appendix D-2 (Board); Regulation Y, 12 CFR 225, appendix 
F (Board); 12 CFR pt. 364, appendix B (FDIC).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In certain circumstances, failure to comply with these specific 
requirements may also violate the CFPA's prohibition on unfair acts or 
practices. The CFPA defines an unfair act or practice as an act or 
practice: (1) that causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to 
consumers, (2) which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers, and (3) 
is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or 
competition.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 12 U.S.C. 5531(c). The unfairness standard in the CFPA is 
similar to the unfairness standard in section 5 of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A practice causes substantial injury to consumers when it causes 
significant harm to a few consumers or a small amount of harm to many 
consumers. For example, inadequate data security measures can cause 
significant harm to a few consumers who become victims of targeted 
identity theft as a result, or it can cause harm to potentially 
millions of consumers when there are large customer-base-wide data 
breaches. Information security weaknesses can result in data breaches, 
cyberattacks, exploits, ransomware attacks, and other exposure of 
consumer data.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Compliance Management Review--Information Technology, CFPB 
Examination Procedures (Sept. 2021), <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_compliance-management-review-information-technology_examination-procedures.pdf">https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_compliance-management-review-information-technology_examination-procedures.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Further, actual injury is not required to satisfy this prong in 
every case. A significant risk of harm is also sufficient. In other 
words, this prong of unfairness is met even in the absence of a data 
breach. Practices that ``are likely to cause'' substantial injury, 
including inadequate data security measures that have not yet resulted 
in a breach, nonetheless satisfy this prong of unfairness.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See, e.g., FTC v. Wyndham Worldwide Corp., 799 F.3d 236, 246 
(3d Cir. 2015) (``Although unfairness claims `usually involve actual 
and completed harms,' `they may also be brought on the basis of 
likely rather than actual injury,' `[and] the FTC Act expressly 
contemplates the possibility that conduct can be unfair before 
actual injury occurs.' '') (interpreting unfairness standard in the 
FTC Act, for which precedent is often used in interpreting the 
similar CFPA standard) (citations omitted).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 54347]]

    Consumers cannot reasonably avoid the harms caused by a firm's data 
security failures. They typically have no way of knowing whether 
appropriate security measures are properly implemented, irrespective of 
disclosures provided. They do not control the creation or 
implementation of an entity's security measures, including an entity's 
information security program. And consumers lack the practical means to 
reasonably avoid harms resulting from data security failures.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ FTC v. Neovi, Inc., 598 F. Supp. 2d 1104, 1115 (S.D. Cal. 
2008) (``[C]onsumers who had their bank accounts accessed without 
authorization had no chance whatsoever to avoid the injury before it 
occurred.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Where companies forgo reasonable cost-efficient measures to protect 
consumer data, like those measures identified below, the CFPB expects 
the risk of substantial injury to consumers will outweigh any purported 
countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. The CFPB is 
unaware of any instance in which a court applying an unfairness 
standard has found that the substantial injury caused or likely to have 
been caused by a company's poor data security practices was outweighed 
by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.\7\ Given the 
harms to consumers from breaches involving sensitive financial 
information, this is not surprising.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

also met its burden of showing that consumer injury was not 
outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to 
competition.''); FTC v. Wyndham Worldwide Corp., 10 F. Supp. 3d 602 
(D.N.J. 2014) (defendant challenged first two elements, but not the 
countervailing benefits finding).

Relevant Precedent

    On July 22, 2019, the CFPB alleged that Equifax violated the CFPA's 
prohibition on unfair acts or practices.\8\ The FTC also alleged that 
Equifax violated the FTC Act and the FTC's Safeguards Rule, which 
implements section 501 of GLBA and establishes certain requirements 
that nonbank financial institutions must adhere to in order to protect 
financial information.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

alleged that Equifax violated the FTC Act's prohibition on unfair 
acts or practices.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In its complaint against Equifax, the CFPB alleged an unfairness 
violation based on Equifax's failure to provide reasonable security for 
sensitive personal information it collected, processed, maintained, or 
stored within computer networks.\10\ In particular, Equifax violated 
the prohibition on unfairness (as well as the FTC's Safeguards Rule) by 
using software that contained a known vulnerability and failing to 
patch the vulnerability for more than four months. Hackers exploited 
the vulnerability to steal over 140 million names, dates of birth, and 
SSNs, as well as millions of telephone numbers, email addresses, and 
physical addresses, and hundreds of thousands of credit card numbers 
and expiration dates.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ Complaint at 40-42, BCFP v. Equifax, Inc., <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_equifax-inc_complaint_2019-07.pdf">https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_equifax-inc_complaint_2019-07.pdf</a>.
    \11\ The CFPB, FTC, and state Attorneys General imposed $700 
million in relief and penalties against Equifax.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Before the Equifax matter, law enforcement actions related to 
inadequate authentication triggered liability under the FTC Act's 
prohibition on unfair practices. In 2006, the FTC sued online check 
processor Qchex and related entities for violating the FTC Act. The FTC 
alleged that it was an unfair practice to create and deliver checks 
without verifying that the person requesting the check was authorized 
to draw checks on the associated bank account.\12\ Qchex created checks 
``even when the customer's name differed from the name on the bank 
account listed on the checks or from the name on the credit card 
account the customer used to pay for [Qchex's] services.'' \13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See Complaint at 10, FTC v. Neovi, Inc., 598 F. Supp. 2d 
1104 (S.D. Cal. 2008) (No. 06 Civ. 1952), aff'd, 604 F.3d 1150 (9th 
Cir. 2010).
    \13\ Id. at 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Even after setting up certain identity verification procedures, 
Qchex bypassed those procedures for some customers.\14\ Ultimately, a 
court observed, ``it was a simple matter for unscrupulous opportunists 
to obtain identity information and draw checks from accounts that were 
not their own.'' \15\ That court confirmed that Qchex injured consumers 
by creating and delivering unverified checks, in violation of section 5 
of the FTC Act.\16\ Implementation of common-sense practices--including 
those that are now required under the FTC's Safeguards Rule--protects 
consumers from injury and that, in turn, mitigates potential liability 
for businesses.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Liability for unfair acts or practices has also been triggered in 
the context of password management and routine software updates. In 
2012, the FTC sued multiple entities associated with the Wyndham 
hospitality company for their failures ``to employ reasonable and 
appropriate measures to protect personal information against 
unauthorized access'' in violation of the FTC Act's prohibitions on 
deceptive and unfair acts and practices.\17\ The inadequate data 
security practices included ``using outdated operating systems that 
could not receive security updates or patches to address known security 
vulnerabilities,'' servers that used ``well-known default user IDs and 
passwords . . . which were easily available to hackers through simple 
internet searches,'' and password management policies that did not 
require ``the use of complex passwords for access to the Wyndham-
branded hotels' property management systems and allow[ing] the use of 
easily guessed passwords.'' \18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ First Amended Complaint at 19, FTC v. Wyndham Worldwide 
Corp., 10 F. Supp. 3d 602 (D.N.J. 2014) (No. 13 Civ. 1887), aff'd, 
799 F.3d 236 (3d Cir. 2015).
    \18\ Id. at 11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FTC alleged that, due to these and other deficient security 
measures, ``intruders were able to gain unauthorized access to 
[Wyndham's] computer network . . . on three separate occasions'' and 
retrieved ``customers' payment card account numbers, expiration dates, 
and security codes.'' \19\ One such incident led to ``the compromise of 
more than 500,000 payment card accounts, and the export of hundreds of 
thousands of consumers' payment card account numbers to a domain 
registered in Russia.'' \20\ When Wyndham argued that data security 
issues were outside the bounds of the FTC's unfairness authority, the 
courts confirmed that ``the FTC has authority to regulate cybersecurity 
under the unfairness prong of'' section 5(a) of the FTC Act and that 
regulated entities have adequate notice that cybersecurity issues could 
lead to violations of that provision.\21\

    In March 2022, the FTC announced an administrative complaint and 
proposed consent orders against Residual Pumpkin Entity, LLC and 
PlanetArt, LLC, respectively the former and current operators of 
CafePress, a customized

[[Page 54348]]

merchandise e-commerce platform.\22\ The FTC's complaint documented 
several inadequate data security practices, including the failure to 
``implement patch management policies and procedures to ensure timely 
remediation of critical security vulnerabilities,'' the failure to 
``establish or enforce rules sufficient to make user credentials (such 
as username and password) hard to guess,'' the failure to disclose 
security incidents to relevant parties, and inadequate ``measures to 
prevent account takeovers through password resets using data known to 
have been obtained by hackers.'' \23\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    While the prohibition on unfair practices is fact-specific, the 
experience of the agencies suggests that failure to implement common 
data security practices will significantly increase the likelihood that 
a firm may be violating the prohibition. In the examples below, the 
Circular describes conduct that will typically meet the first two 
elements of an unfairness claim (likely to cause substantial injury to 
consumers that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers), and thus 
increase the likelihood that an entity's conduct triggers liability 
under the CFPA's prohibition of unfair practices.

1. Multi-Factor Authentication

    Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security enhancement that 
requires multiple credentials (factors) before an account can be 
accessed.\24\ Factors fall into three categories: something you know, 
like a password; something you have, like a token; and something you 
are, like your fingerprint. A common MFA setup is supplying both a 
password and a temporary numeric code in order to log in. Another MFA 
factor is the use of hardware identification devices. MFA greatly 
increases the level of difficulty for adversaries to compromise 
enterprise user accounts, and thus gain access to sensitive customer 
data. MFA solutions that protect against credential phishing, such as 
those using the Web Authentication standard supported by web browsers, 
are especially important.

should I care?, National Institute of Standards and Technology,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If a covered person or service provider does not require MFA for 
its employees or offer multi-factor authentication as an option for 
consumers accessing systems and accounts, or has not implemented a 
reasonably secure equivalent, it is unlikely that the entity could 
demonstrate that countervailing benefits to consumers or competition 
outweigh the potential harms, thus triggering liability.\25\

Factor Authentication page, or the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology's (NIST's) Digital Identity Guidelines. Multi-Factor

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Password Management

    Unauthorized use of passwords is a common data security issue. 
Username and password combinations can be sold on the dark web or 
posted for free on the internet, which can be used to access not just 
the accounts in question, but other accounts held by the consumer or 
employee.
    If a covered person or service provider does not have adequate 
password management policies and practices, it is unlikely they would 
succeed in showing countervailing benefits to consumers or competition 
that outweigh the potential harms, thus triggering liability.\26\ This 
includes failing to have processes in place to monitor for breaches at 
other entities where employees may be re-using logins and passwords 
(including notifying users when a password reset is required as a 
result) and includes use of default enterprise logins or passwords.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Timely Software Updates

    Software vendors regularly update software to address security 
vulnerabilities within a program or product. When patches are released, 
the public, including hackers, become aware of the prior 
vulnerabilities. Therefore, when companies use commonly available 
software, including open-source software and open-source libraries,\27\ 
and do not install a patch that has been released for that software or 
take other mitigating steps if patching is not possible, they neglect 
to fix a security vulnerability that has become widely known. As noted 
in the CFPB's complaint against Equifax, Equifax's 2017 failure to 
patch a known vulnerability resulted in hackers gaining access to 
Equifax's systems that exposed the personal information of nearly 148 
million consumers.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ FTC warns companies to remediate Log4j security 
vulnerability (Jan. 4, 2022), <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2022/01/ftc-warns-companies-remediate-log4j-security-vulnerability">https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2022/01/ftc-warns-companies-remediate-log4j-security-vulnerability</a>. (``Log4j is a ubiquitous piece of software 
used to record activities in a wide range of systems found in 
consumer-facing products and services. Recently, a serious 
vulnerability in the popular Java logging package, Log4j (CVE-2021-
44228) was disclosed, posing a severe risk to millions of consumer 
products to enterprise software and web applications.'')
    \28\ Complaint at 13, BCFP v. Equifax, Inc., <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_equifax-inc_complaint_2019-07.pdf">https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_equifax-inc_complaint_2019-07.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If covered persons or service providers do not routinely update 
systems, software, and code (including those utilized by contractors) 
or fail to update them when notified of a critical vulnerability, it is 
unlikely they would succeed in showing countervailing benefits to 
consumers or competition that outweigh the potential harms, thus 
triggering liability. This includes not having asset inventories of 
which systems contain dependencies on certain software to make sure 
software is up to date and highlight needs for patches and updates. It 
also includes the use of versions of software that are no longer 
actively maintained by their vendors.

About Consumer Financial Protection Circulars

    Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are issued to all parties 
with authority to enforce Federal consumer financial law. The CFPB is 
the principal Federal regulator responsible for administering Federal 
consumer financial law, see 12 U.S.C. 5511, including the Consumer 
Financial Protection Act's prohibition on unfair, deceptive, and 
abusive acts or practices, 12 U.S.C. 5536(a)(1)(B), and 18 other 
``enumerated consumer laws,'' 12 U.S.C. 5481(12). However, these laws 
are also enforced by State attorneys general and State regulators, 12 
U.S.C. 5552, and prudential regulators including the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the National 
Credit Union Administration. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 5516(d), 5581(c)(2) 
(exclusive enforcement authority for banks and credit unions with $10 
billion or less in assets). Some Federal consumer financial laws are 
also enforceable by other Federal agencies, including the Department of 
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the Farm Credit 
Administration, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of 
Agriculture. In addition, some of these laws provide for private 
enforcement.
    Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are intended to promote

[[Page 54349]]

consistency in approach across the various enforcement agencies and 
parties, pursuant to the CFPB's statutory objective to ensure Federal 
consumer financial law is enforced consistently. 12 U.S.C. 5511(b)(4).
    Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are also intended to 
provide transparency to partner agencies regarding the CFPB's intended 
approach when cooperating in enforcement actions. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 
5552(b) (consultation with CFPB by State attorneys general and 
regulators); 12 U.S.C. 5562(a) (joint investigatory work between CFPB 
and other agencies).
    Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are general statements of 
policy under the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. 553(b). They 
provide background information about applicable law, articulate 
considerations relevant to the Bureau's exercise of its authorities, 
and, in the interest of maintaining consistency, advise other parties 
with authority to enforce Federal consumer financial law. They do not 
restrict the Bureau's exercise of its authorities, impose any legal 
requirements on external parties, or create or confer any rights on 
external parties that could be enforceable in any administrative or 
civil proceeding. The CFPB Director is instructing CFPB staff as 
described herein, and the CFPB will then make final decisions on 
individual matters based on an assessment of the factual record, 
applicable law, and factors relevant to prosecutorial discretion.
