FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION

12 CFR Part 370

RIN 3064-AD37

 
Expiration of the Issuance Period for the Debt Guarantee Program; 
Establishment of Emergency Guarantee Facility

AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FDIC is issuing this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to 
present two alternatives for phasing out the Debt Guarantee Program 
(DGP), a component of the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP).
    Under the first alternative, the DGP would conclude as provided in 
the current regulation. Thus, insured depository institutions (IDIs) 
and certain other participating entities would be permitted to issue 
FDIC-guaranteed debt no later than October 31, 2009, with the FDIC's 
guarantee for such debt expiring no later than December 31, 2012.
    Under the second alternative, the DGP would expire as indicated 
above; however, the FDIC would establish a limited six-month emergency 
guarantee facility to be made available in emergency circumstances to 
insured depository institutions (IDIs) and certain other entities 
participating in the DGP upon application to and with the prior 
approval of the FDIC. Under the proposed emergency guarantee facility, 
the FDIC would guarantee senior unsecured debt issued on or before 
April 30, 2010. The emergency guarantee facility would be available on 
a limited, case-by-case basis to insured depository institutions (IDIs) 
participating in the DGP and to other entities participating in the DGP 
that have issued FDIC-guaranteed debt under the DGP by September 9, 
2009. Entities seeking to participate in the emergency guarantee 
facility would be required to submit an application to the FDIC on or 
before April 30, 2010, and demonstrate an inability to issue non-
guaranteed debt to replace maturing senior unsecured debt as a result 
of market disruptions or other circumstances beyond the entity's 
control. If approved by the FDIC, senior unsecured debt issued under 
the emergency guarantee facility would be guaranteed by the FDIC until 
a date no later than December 31, 2012, and would be subject to an 
annualized participation fee of at least 300 basis points.

DATES: Written comments must be received by the FDIC by October 1, 
2009.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background

    The FDIC adopted the TLGP in October, 2008 following a 
determination of systemic risk by the Secretary of the Treasury (after 
consultation with the President) that was supported by recommendations 
from the FDIC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(Federal Reserve).\1\ The TLGP is part of a coordinated effort by the 
FDIC, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and the Federal 
Reserve to address unprecedented disruptions in credit markets and the 
resultant difficulty of many financial institutions to obtain funds and 
to make loans to creditworthy borrowers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See Section 13(c)(4)(G) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
(FDI Act), 12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)(G). The determination of systemic 
risk triggered the FDIC's authority--``in its sole discretion and 
upon such terms and conditions as the [FDIC's] Board of Directors 
may prescribe--to take actions to avoid or mitigate serious adverse 
effects on economic conditions or financial stability. See also 
Section 9(a)Tenth of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1819(a)Tenth. The FDIC 
implemented the TLGP in response.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On October 23, 2008, the FDIC's Board of Directors (Board) 
authorized the publication in the Federal Register of an interim rule 
that outlined the structure of the TLGP.\2\ Designed to assist in the 
stabilization of the nation's financial system, the FDIC's TLGP is 
composed of two distinct components: the DGP and the Transaction 
Account Guarantee Program (TAG program). The DGP initially permitted 
participating entities to issue FDIC-guaranteed senior unsecured debt 
until June 30, 2009, with the FDIC's guarantee for such debt to expire 
on the earlier of the maturity of the debt (or the conversion date, for 
mandatory convertible debt) or June 30, 2012.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 73 FR 64179 (October 29, 2008). This interim rule was 
finalized and a final rule was published in the Federal Register on 
November 26, 2008. 73 FR 72244 (November 26, 2008).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To reduce market disruption at the conclusion of the DGP and to 
facilitate the orderly phase-out of the program, the Board issued a 
final rule that generally extended for four months the period during 
which participating entities could issue FDIC-guaranteed debt.\3\ Under 
this rule, all IDIs and those other participating entities that had 
issued FDIC-guaranteed debt on or

[[Page 47490]]

before April 1, 2009 are permitted to participate in the extended DGP 
without application to the FDIC. Other participating entities that 
receive approval from the FDIC also may participate in the extended 
DGP. The rule also extended the expiration of the guarantee period from 
June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012. As a result, participating entities 
may issue FDIC-guaranteed debt through and including October 31, 2009, 
where the FDIC's guarantee expires on the earliest of the debt's 
mandatory conversion date, the stated maturity date, or December 31, 
2012.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 74 FR 26521 (June 3, 2009).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On June 23, 2009, the Board proposed two alternatives for phasing 
out the TAG. The first proposed alternative provided that the TAG would 
expire on December 31, 2009, as required by the terms of the existing 
rule. The second proposed alternative provided for a limited six month 
extension to that program. Following consideration of the comments 
submitted in response to the two alternatives, on August 26, 2009, the 
Board adopted and approved for publication in the Federal Register a 
final rule providing for a six-month extension of the TAG program, 
through June 30, 2010.\4\ The extended TAG program is available to any 
participating IDI that does not elect to opt-out of the extension, 
subject to an increased fee for the FDIC's guarantee of qualifying non-
interest bearing transaction accounts during the extension period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 74 FR 45093 (September 1, 2009).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Recent data suggest that the TLGP and other federal efforts to 
restore liquidity to and confidence in the banking and financial 
services industries have had a positive impact. For example, only a few 
participating entities have issued FDIC-guaranteed debt under the 
extended DGP, and a number of banking organizations have conducted 
successful public offerings of non-FDIC-guaranteed debt and equity. A 
number of banking organizations also have repaid the preferred shares 
purchased by the U.S. Treasury through its Capital Purchase Program. 
Funding costs have eased as the three-month Libor rate has reached 
record lows and related credit spreads have moderated substantially.
    Since there is evidence that the domestic credit and liquidity 
markets are beginning to normalize and since there has been a decrease 
in the number of entities that now are issuing debt under the DGP, the 
current regulation may provide an appropriate means for concluding the 
DGP. On the other hand, however, it may be prudent for the FDIC to 
allow the DGP to expire by its terms, while establishing an emergency 
guarantee facility to be accessed on a limited, case-by-case basis by 
IDIs and certain other entities participating in the DGP if emergency 
circumstances warrant. This limited emergency guarantee facility could 
afford protection to entities participating in the DGP that are unable 
to issue non-guaranteed debt to replace maturing debt because of market 
disruptions or other circumstances beyond their control.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Establishment of the emergency guarantee facility would be 
consistent with the rationale for establishing the existing TLGP and 
the determination of systemic risk made on October 14, 2008, 
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. section 1823(c)(4)(G), by the Secretary of the 
Treasury (after consultation with the President) following receipt 
of the written recommendation dated October 13, 2008, of the FDIC's 
Board of Directors (Board) and the similar written recommendation of 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal 
Reserve). In addition to the authority granted to the FDIC by the 
systemic risk determination, the FDIC is authorized under Section 
9(a)(Tenth) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1819(a)Tenth, to prescribe, by 
its Board, such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary to 
carry out the provisions of the FDI Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Proposed Alternatives for Concluding the Debt Guarantee Program

    As it did when proposing alternatives for concluding the TAG, in 
this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking the FDIC presents two alternatives 
for concluding the FDIC's guarantee of senior unsecured debt under the 
DGP. In general, under Alternative A, IDIs and certain other 
participating entities would be permitted to issue FDIC-guaranteed debt 
under the DGP no later than October 31, 2009, with the FDIC's guarantee 
for such debt expiring no later than December 31, 2012, as provided for 
in the current regulation. Under Alternative B, although the DGP 
effectively would end as provided for in the current regulation, the 
FDIC would establish and make available on a limited, case-by-case 
basis, an emergency guarantee facility. The proposed emergency 
guarantee facility would be made available only following FDIC approval 
of an application submitted by an IDI or other entity that issued FDIC-
guaranteed senior unsecured debt on or before September 9, 2009. If 
approved by the FDIC, an applicant would be permitted to issue FDIC-
guaranteed senior unsecured debt during the period between November 1, 
2009 and April 30, 2010, subject to any other restrictions and 
conditions deemed appropriate by the FDIC, including limiting executive 
compensation, bonuses, or the payment of dividends.

A. Alternative A

    Alternative A would preserve the current regulation regarding the 
duration of the FDIC's guarantee of senior unsecured debt under the 
DGP. Thus, all IDIs participating in the DGP (and other participating 
entities that had either issued guaranteed debt before April 1, 2009, 
or had not issued guaranteed debt before April 1, 2009, but had 
otherwise received the FDIC's permission to issue non-guaranteed debt) 
would be permitted to issue FDIC-guaranteed senior unsecured debt until 
October 31, 2009. The FDIC's guarantee for such debt issuances would 
expire no later than December 31, 2012.

B. Alternative B

    Under Alternative B, the DGP would expire as currently structured. 
In Alternative B, however, the FDIC proposes the establishment of a 
limited, six-month emergency guarantee facility upon expiration of the 
DGP on October 31, 2009, as currently structured.
    This emergency guarantee facility would be designed to address an 
entity's inability to replace maturing debt through non-guaranteed 
sources as a result of a market disruption or other circumstance beyond 
the control of the participating entity. Under this emergency guarantee 
facility, the FDIC, after prior approval granted on a case-by-case 
basis, would guarantee senior unsecured debt (as defined in 12 CFR 
370.2(e)) issued by certain entities participating in the DGP after 
October 31, 2009, through and including April 30, 2010, subject to 
restrictions and conditions deemed appropriate by the FDIC. The FDIC's 
guarantee of principal and interest payments for senior unsecured debt 
issuances approved under the emergency guarantee facility would extend 
through the earliest of the mandatory conversion date (for mandatory 
convertible debt), the stated maturity date, or December 31, 2012. If 
Alternative B were adopted, with the exception of the prior approval 
requirement and the increased participation fee, the terms of the FDIC 
guarantee would remain unchanged from the existing DGP. Further, should 
Alternative B be adopted, there would be no effect on any conditions 
that the FDIC may have placed on the issuance of debt by an IDI or 
other entity participating in the DGP.
    Any IDI participating in the DGP and any other entity participating 
in the DGP that has issued FDIC-guaranteed debt by September 9, 2009, 
would be permitted to apply to use this emergency guarantee facility. 
Any use of the facility would require the prior

[[Page 47491]]

approval of the FDIC which is expected to be provided on a limited 
basis following case-by-case consideration.
Application Requirements for Participation in the Emergency Guarantee 
Facility
    Applications to participate in the emergency guarantee facility 
would be required to be submitted to the Director of the Division of 
Supervision and Consumer Protection on or before April 30, 2010. The 
application would be expected to include a projection of the sources 
and uses of funds through December 31, 2012; a summary of the entity's 
contingency plans; a description of any collateral that an entity can 
make available to secure the entity's obligation to reimburse the FDIC 
for any payments made pursuant to the guarantee; a description of the 
plans for retirement of the FDIC-guaranteed debt; a description of the 
market disruptions or other circumstances beyond the entity's control 
that prevent the entity from replacing maturing debt with non-
guaranteed debt; a description of management's efforts to mitigate the 
effects of such disruptions or circumstances; conclusive evidence that 
demonstrates an entity's inability to issue non-guaranteed debt; and 
any other relevant information that the FDIC deems appropriate.
    Participation in the emergency guarantee facility would be limited 
only to those entities that demonstrated the inability to issue non-
guaranteed debt to replace maturing debt as a result of market 
disruptions or other circumstances beyond the entities' control. In 
order for an application to be accepted and considered by the FDIC, 
applicants would be required to describe the circumstances that gave 
rise to the request to participate in the emergency guarantee facility 
and also must include an explanation of how and the extent to which 
such circumstances were unanticipated by the applicant and remain 
beyond its control. In addition, applicants would be expected to 
include an explanation of the actions taken by its management to 
mitigate such circumstances.
Participation Fee
    Under Alternative B, the FDIC would assess an annualized 
participation fee of at least 300 basis points on any FDIC-guaranteed 
debt issued by entities that are permitted to use the emergency 
guarantee facility. The FDIC would reserve the right to increase the 
participation fee on a case-by-case basis, depending upon the risks 
present in the issuing entity's organization. The FDIC notes that the 
participation fee may provide an appropriate deterrent to applications 
based on other, less severe circumstances or concerns. Consistent with 
the existing DGP, a participating entity may be required to pledge 
sufficient collateral to ensure the repayment of any principal and 
interest payments made by the FDIC under the guarantee facility, and 
also may be subject to other conditions and restrictions that the FDIC 
deems appropriate, including, for example, limiting executive 
compensation, bonuses, or the payment of dividends.

IV. Request for Comments

    The FDIC requests comments on all aspects of this notice. 
Specifically, the FDIC notes that, upon approval of application, the 
emergency guarantee facility proposed in Alternative B would be 
available to all participating IDIs and to those other entities that 
had issued FDIC-guaranteed debt by September 9, 2009. The FDIC requests 
comment as to whether, if Alternative B is adopted, eligibility should 
be limited in this manner. Finally, the FDIC asks commenters to 
indicate a preference for either Alternative A or Alternative B as a 
means of providing the most appropriate phase out of the FDIC's DGP.

V. Regulatory Analysis and Procedure

A. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    In accordance with section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(RFA), 5 U.S.C. 603(a), the FDIC must publish an initial regulatory 
flexibility analysis with this proposed rulemaking or certify that the 
proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA 
analysis or certification, financial institutions with total assets of 
$175 million or less are considered to be ``small entities.'' The FDIC 
hereby certifies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the Alternative B of 
the proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. (Alternative A, as 
described in the proposed rule, represents no change from the FDIC's 
existing regulation. As such, Alternative A is not likely to have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.)
    Currently, 4,424 IDIs participate in the DGP, of which 
approximately 2,136 (or approximately 48 percent) are small entities. 
If Alternative B is adopted, all 2,136 IDIs that are considered small 
entities for purposes of this analysis would be eligible to apply to 
access the emergency guarantee facility. As a result, the FDIC asserts 
that Alternative B could have some impact on a substantial number of 
IDIs that are small entities that participate in the DGP.
    Nevertheless, the FDIC has determined that, were Alternative B of 
the proposed rule to be adopted, the economic impact on small entities 
will not be significant for the following reasons. The emergency 
guarantee facility as contemplated in Alternative B is designed to be 
accessed on an emergency case-by-case basis by IDIs (and other entities 
that issued debt under the DGP) only if such entities are unable to 
replace maturing debt as a result of market disruptions or other 
circumstances beyond the entities' control. Eighty-one IDIs have issued 
FDIC-guaranteed debt through the DGP since the program's inception. It 
appears unlikely that a significant number of IDIs (or other qualifying 
entities) would satisfy the requirements to issue FDIC-guaranteed debt 
during such emergency circumstances. Accordingly, if adopted in final 
form, neither Alternate A nor Alternate B of the proposed rule would 
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities.

B. Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
3501 et seq.), an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is 
not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number. If Alternative B were 
adopted, the Proposed Rule would establish a new OMB-approved 
information collection, entitled the ``Temporary Liquidity Guarantee 
Program--Emergency Guarantee Facility'' (OMB No. 3064--NEW). (Should 
Alternative A be adopted, no change would occur in the existing 
regulation or the existing burden estimates.) Should Alternative B be 
adopted, the estimated burden for the proposed application process, 
described in Alternative B of the Proposed Rule, is as follows:
    Title: ``Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program--Emergency Guarantee 
Facility''.
    OMB Number: 3064--NEW.
    Estimated Number of Respondents:
    Application to access emergency guarantee facility submitted by 
IDIs--8.
    Application to access emergency guarantee facility submitted by 
non-IDIs that issued FDIC-guaranteed debt under the DGP--4.
    Frequency of Response:
    Application to access emergency guarantee facility submitted by 
IDIs--once.

[[Page 47492]]

    Application to access emergency guarantee facility submitted by 
non-IDIs that issued FDIC-guaranteed debt under the DGP--once.
    Affected Public: IDIs; thrift holding companies, bank and financial 
holding companies, and affiliates of IDIs that issued debt under the 
DGP.
    Average Time per Response: Application to access emergency 
guarantee facility submitted by IDIs--4 hours.
    Application to access emergency guarantee facility submitted by 
non-IDIs that issued FDIC-guaranteed debt under the DGP--4 hours.
    Estimated Annual Burden:
    Application to access emergency guarantee facility submitted by 
IDIs--32 hours.
    Application to access emergency guarantee facility submitted by 
non-IDIs that issued FDIC-guaranteed debt under the DGP--16 hours.
    Total Annual Burden--48 hours.
    The FDIC is requesting comment on the new TLGP-related information 
collection proposed in Alternative B. The FDIC is also giving notice 
that the proposed collection of information has been submitted to OMB 
for review and approval. Comments are invited on: (1) Whether this 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the FDIC's functions, including whether the information has practical 
utility; (2) the accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the 
information collection, including the validity of the methodologies and 
assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity 
of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden 
of the information collection on respondents, including through the use 
of automated collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology. Interested parties are invited to submit written comments 
on the estimated burden by any of the following methods:

the FDIC, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of 
Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, Room 3208, 
Washington, DC 20503. All comments should refer to the name and number 
of the collection.

C. Solicitation of Comments on Use of Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Public Law 106-102, 113 
Stat. 1338, 1471 (Nov. 12, 1999), requires the federal banking agencies 
to use plain language in all proposed and final rules published after 
January 1, 2000. The FDIC invites your comments on how to make this 
proposed regulation easier to understand. For example:
    <bullet> Has the FDIC organized the material to suit your needs? If 
not, how could this material be better organized?
    <bullet> Are the requirements in the proposed rule clearly stated? 
If not, how could the proposed rule be more clearly stated?
    <bullet> Does the proposed rule contain language or jargon that is 
not clear? If so, which language requires clarification?
    <bullet> Would a different format (grouping and order of sections, 
use of headings, paragraphing) make the proposed rule easier to 
understand? If so, what changes to the format would make the proposed 
rule easier to understand?
    <bullet> What else could the FDIC do to make the proposed rule 
easier to understand?

D. The Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999--
Assessment of Federal Regulations and Policies on Families

    The FDIC has determined that the proposed rule will not affect 
family well-being within the measure of section 654 of the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations Act, enacted as part of the Omnibus 
Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 
(Pub. L. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681).

List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 370

    Banks, Banking, Bank deposit insurance, Holding companies, National 
banks, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Savings associations.

    For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation proposes to amend 12 CFR Part 370 as follows:

PART 370--TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM

    1. The authority citation for part 370 continues to read as 
follows:

    Authority:  12 U.S.C. 1813(l), 1813(m), 1817(i), 1818, 
1819(a)(Tenth), 1820(f), 1821(a), 1821(c), 1821(d), 1823(c)(4).

    2. Amend Sec.  370.2 by revising paragraph (n) to read as follows:


Sec.  370.2  Definitions.

* * * * *
