Import Restrictions Imposed on Categories of Archaeological and 
Ethnological Material of Turkey

AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland 
Security; Department of the Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This final rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) regulations to reflect the imposition of import restrictions on 
certain categories of archaeological and ethnological material from the 
Republic of Turkey (Turkey). These restrictions are being imposed 
pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Turkey that has 
been entered into under the authority of the Convention on Cultural 
Property Implementation Act. This final rule amends the CBP regulations 
by adding Turkey to the list of countries which have a bilateral 
agreement with the United States that imposes cultural property import 
restrictions. This final rule also contains the Designated List that 
describes the types of archaeological and ethnological material to 
which the restrictions apply.

DATES: Effective on June 16, 2021.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, Public Law 
97-446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. (hereinafter, ``the Cultural Property 
Implementation Act'') implements the 1970 United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on the Means 
of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer 
of Ownership of Cultural Property (hereinafter, ``the Convention'' (823 
U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)). Pursuant to the Cultural Property Implementation 
Act, the United States entered into a bilateral agreement with the 
Republic of Turkey (Turkey) to impose import restrictions on certain 
archaeological and ethnological material from Turkey. This rule 
announces that the United States is now imposing import restrictions on 
certain archaeological and ethnological material from Turkey.

Determinations

    Under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1), the United States must make certain 
determinations before entering into an agreement to impose import 
restrictions under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). On March 27, 2020, the 
Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States 
Department of State, after consultation with and recommendation by the 
Cultural Property Advisory Committee, made the determinations required 
under the statute with respect to certain archaeological and 
ethnological material originating in Turkey that is described in the 
Designated List set forth below in this document.
    These determinations include the following: (1) That the cultural 
patrimony of Turkey is in jeopardy from the pillage of archaeological 
material representing Turkey's cultural heritage dating from 
approximately 1.2 million years ago to A.D. 1770, and ethnological 
material dating from approximately the 1st century A.D. to A.D. 1923; 
(2) that the Turkish government has taken measures consistent with the 
Convention to protect its cultural patrimony (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(B)); 
(3) that import restrictions imposed by the United States would be of 
substantial benefit in deterring a serious situation of pillage and 
remedies less drastic are not available (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(C)); and 
(4) that the application of import restrictions as set forth in this 
final rule is consistent with the general interests of the 
international community in the interchange of cultural property among 
nations for scientific, cultural, and educational purposes (19 U.S.C. 
2602(a)(1)(D)). The Assistant Secretary also found that the material 
described in the determinations meets the statutory definition of 
``archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party'' (19 
U.S.C. 2601(2)).

The Agreement

    On January 19, 2021, the United States and Turkey signed a 
bilateral agreement, ``Memorandum of Understanding between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Republic of Turkey Concerning the Imposition of Import Restrictions on 
Categories of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Turkey'' 
(``the Agreement''), pursuant to the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 
2602(a)(2). The Agreement entered into force on March 24, 2021, upon 
the exchange of diplomatic notes, and enables the promulgation of 
import restrictions on categories of archaeological material, ranging 
in date from approximately 1.2 million years ago to A.D. 1770, and 
ethnological material, ranging in date from the 1st century A.D. to 
A.D. 1923, representing Turkey's cultural heritage. A list of the 
categories of archaeological and ethnological material subject to the 
import restrictions is set forth later in this document.

Restriction and Amendment to the Regulations

    In accordance with the Agreement, importation of material 
designated below is subject to the restrictions of 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 
Sec.  12.104g(a) of title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 
12.104g(a)) and will be restricted from entry into the United States 
unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and Sec.  12.104c of 
the CBP Regulations (19 CFR 12.104c) are met. CBP is amending Sec.  
12.104g(a) of the CBP Regulations (19 CFR 12.104g(a)) to indicate that 
these import restrictions have been imposed.
    Import restrictions listed as 19 CFR 12.104g(a) are effective for 
no more than five years beginning on the date on which the Agreement 
enters into force with respect to the United States. This period may be 
extended for additional periods of not more than five years if it is 
determined that the factors which justified the Agreement still pertain 
and no cause for suspension of the Agreement exists. The import

[[Page 31911]]

restrictions will expire on March 24, 2026, unless extended.

cups, jars, pots, urns, and ritual vessels in the shape of a woman or 
animal. Some examples are painted with yellow, brown, or red; patterns 
include concentric circles, horizontal lines, and geometric motifs over 
cream or red slip.

amphikypellon), beak-spouted pitchers, anthropomorphic jars, pedestal 
bowls, amphorae, vases, double-/triple-/quadruple vessels (two or more 
cups or bowls attached at a central point to form a single vessel), 
mugs, boxes, and small pots with lids (pyxis).
    c. Middle and Late Bronze Age--This type includes Assyrian Trade 
Colonial, Hittite, and early Mycenaean pottery. In this period, ceramic 
lathe and glaze techniques became common and forms became thinner. Type 
includes ceremonial vessels in the shape of animals (rythons), plates, 
double-handled drinking vessels (kantharos), bathing bowls, and vases.
    d. Geometric, Orientalizing, Archaic, and Classical Periods--This

noted in previous time periods, as well as small bottles (unguentarium) 
and wine jars (lagynos). There is less decorative painting in this

Roman tableware (terra sigillata) is also common.
    f. Byzantine Period--Vessel types include amphorae, bowls, plates, 
chalices, beakers, and special shapes such as pilgrim flasks. Types

various techniques and motifs such as human figures, animals, florals, 
and other symbolic motifs.

vessels that may be in the vessel shapes mentioned above. In addition, 
this type includes inkstands, chalices, lamps, rose water flasks,

cross, mythological creatures, human and animal figures, natural and 
floral motifs, geometric motifs, and inscriptions. During the Ottoman 
Period, most tiles are decorated with floral motifs, including the saz 
style with composite flowers and saz leaves. Glazed bricks used in this 
period are also included. Approximate date: 11th century to the 18th 
century A.D.
