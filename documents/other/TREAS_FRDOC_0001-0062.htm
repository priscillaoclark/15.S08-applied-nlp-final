Cost or Value of Foreign Repairs, Alterations, or Processing

AGENCIES: Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland 
Security; Department of the Treasury.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document proposes to amend the U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) Regulations to exclude from the dutiable value of 
repairs, alterations, or processing performed abroad on articles 
exported from the United States and returned under subheading 
9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, or 9802.00.60, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTSUS), the value of U.S.-origin parts used in the 
foreign repairs, alterations, or processing. The proposed changes would 
provide an incentive to use U.S.-origin parts in the foreign repairs, 
alterations, or processing of articles entered under the above-
referenced HTSUS provisions.

Background

    Subheadings 9802.00.40 and 9802.00.50, HTSUS, provide a partial 
duty exemption for articles returned to the United States after having 
been exported to be advanced in value or improved in condition by 
repairs or alterations. Subheading 9802.00.40 encompasses articles 
repaired or altered abroad pursuant to a warranty, while subheading 
9802.00.50 encompasses articles repaired or altered abroad other than 
pursuant to a warranty. Articles entitled to classification under these 
tariff provisions are assessed duty based upon the value of the repairs 
or alterations.
    Subheading 9802.00.60, HTSUS, provides a partial duty exemption for 
articles of metal manufactured in the United States that are exported 
for further processing and then returned to the United States for 
further processing. Articles entitled to classification under this 
tariff provision are assessed duty based upon the value of the 
processing performed outside the United States.
    U.S. Note 3(a), subchapter II, Chapter 98, HTSUS, states, in 
pertinent part, that for purposes of subheadings 9802.00.40, 
9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60, HTSUS, the ``value of repairs, alterations, 
processing or other change in condition outside the United States'' is 
the cost to the importer of such change, or if no charge is made, the 
value of such change. Section 10.8 of the CBP regulations (19 CFR 
10.8), which implements subheadings 9802.00.40 and 9802.00.50, provides 
in paragraph (d) that the ``cost or value of repairs or alterations'' 
is limited to the cost or value of the repairs or alterations actually 
performed abroad, which will include all domestic and foreign articles 
furnished for the repairs or alterations, but will not include any of 
the expenses incurred in this country whether by way of engineering 
costs, preparation of plans or specifications, furnishing of tools or 
equipment for doing the repairs or alterations abroad, or otherwise.
    Similarly, Sec.  10.9 of the CBP regulations (19 CFR 10.9(d)), 
which implements subheading 9802.00.60, provides in paragraph (d) that 
the ``cost or value of processing'' is limited to the cost or value of 
the processing actually performed abroad, which will include all 
domestic and foreign articles used in the processing, but will not 
include the exported U.S. metal article or any of the expenses incurred 
in this country whether by way of engineering costs, preparation of 
plans or specifications, furnishing of tools or equipment for doing the 
processing abroad, or otherwise.

[[Page 10850]]

    The words ``which will include all domestic and foreign articles 
furnished for the repairs or alterations'' in Sec.  10.8(d) and the 
words ``which will include all domestic and foreign articles used in 
the processing'' in Sec.  10.9(d) were added to those regulatory 
provisions by T.D. 72-119, which was published in the Federal Register 
on May 2, 1972 (37 FR 8867). Neither T.D. 72-119 nor the notice of 
proposed rulemaking (published in the Federal Register on May 4, 1971 
(36 FR 8312)) which preceded the T.D. included any explanation or 
discussion regarding the above-referenced language added to Sec. Sec.  
10.8(d) and 10.9(d). However, the addition of this language has had the 
effect of requiring the value of U.S.- and foreign-origin parts used in 
the foreign repairs, alterations, or processing to be included in the 
dutiable value of articles entered under subheadings 9802.00.40, 
9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60, HTSUS.

Explanation of Amendments

    As indicated in the above background discussion, there is nothing 
in the underlying statutory provisions (subheadings 9802.00.40, 
9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60 and U.S. Note 3(a), subchapter II, Chapter 
98, HTSUS) that mandates the inclusion of the value of U.S.-origin 
parts in the dutiable value of articles entered under these tariff 
provisions. The policy of requiring the value of U.S.-origin parts to 
be included in dutiable value under these circumstances, as reflected 
in the implementing regulations, clearly provides no incentive to use 
U.S., as opposed to foreign, parts in the foreign repairs, alterations, 
or processing. In order to encourage the use of U.S.-origin parts in 
the foreign repairs, alterations, or processing of articles entered 
under subheading 9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60, CBP is 
proposing to amend Sec. Sec.  10.8(d) and 10.9(d) by removing the words 
``domestic and'' in the second sentence of each of these regulatory 
provisions.
    This document also proposes to edit Sec. Sec.  10.8(d) and 10.9(d) 
by replacing the word ``shall'' each place it appears with the word 
``will''.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866

    Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.), it is certified that, if adopted, the proposed 
amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The proposed rule would have the effect of 
excluding the value of U.S.-origin parts from the dutiable value of 
articles entered under subheadings 9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 
9802.00.60, HTSUS, thereby providing an incentive to use U.S.-origin 
parts in the foreign repairs, alterations, or processing of articles 
entered under these HTSUS provisions. As a result, it is expected that 
the proposed amendments will have the potential of providing a slight 
economic benefit for U.S. commercial interests. Accordingly, the 
proposed amendments are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other 
requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. This document does not meet the 
criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in E.O. 
12866.

Signing Authority

    This document is being issued by CBP in accordance with Sec.  
0.1(a)(1) of the CBP Regulations (19 CFR 0.1(a)(1)), pertaining to the 
authority of the Secretary of the Treasury (or his/her delegate) to
