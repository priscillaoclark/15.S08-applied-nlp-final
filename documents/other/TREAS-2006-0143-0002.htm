Extension of Import Restrictions Imposed on Pre-Classical and 
Classical Archaeological Objects and Byzantine Period Ecclesiastical 
and Ritual Ethnological Material From Cyprus

AGENCIES: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland 
Security; Department of the Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document amends U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
regulations to reflect the extension of import restrictions on Pre-
Classical and Classical Archaeological Objects and Byzantine 
Ecclesiastical and Ritual Ethnological Material from Cyprus which were 
imposed by Treasury Decision (T.D.) 02-37 and CBP Dec. 06-22. The 
Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States 
Department of State, has determined that conditions continue to warrant 
the imposition of import restrictions. Accordingly, the restrictions 
will remain in effect for an additional 5 years, and the CBP 
regulations are being amended to indicate this extension. These 
restrictions are being extended pursuant to determinations of the 
United States Department of State made under the terms of the 
Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act in accordance with 
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the 
Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. 
This document also contains the Designated List of Archaeological 
Objects and Ethnological Material that describes the articles to which 
the restrictions apply. Note that one subcategory, Coins of Cypriot 
Types, has been added to the category entitled Metal.

EFFECTIVE DATE: July 16, 2007.

Esq., Chief, Intellectual Property Rights and Restricted Merchandise 
Branch, (202) 572-8710. For operational aspects, Michael Craig, Chief,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background

    Pursuant to the provisions of the 1970 United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention, codified into 
U.S. law as the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act 
(Pub. L. 97-446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.), the United States entered 
into a bilateral agreement with the Republic of Cyprus on July 16, 
2002, concerning the imposition of import restrictions on certain 
archaeological material of Cyprus representing the Pre-Classical and 
Classical periods of its cultural heritage. On July 19, 2002, the 
former United States Customs Service published Treasury Decision (T.D.) 
02-37 in the Federal Register (67 FR

[[Page 38471]]

47447), which amended 19 CFR 12.104g(a) to reflect the imposition of 
these restrictions, and included a list designating the types of 
archaeological materials covered by the restrictions.
    Import restrictions listed in 19 CFR 12.104g(a) are ``effective for 
no more than five years beginning on the date on which the agreement 
enters into force with respect to the United States. This period can be 
extended for additional periods not to exceed five years if it is 
determined that the factors which justified the initial agreement still 
pertain and no cause for suspension of the agreement exists'' (19 CFR 
12.104g(a)). T.D. 02-37 is set to expire on July 16, 2007.
    We note that prior to the issuance of T.D. 02-37, the former United 
States Customs Service had issued T.D. 99-35 (64 FR 17529, April 12, 
1999) imposing ``emergency'' import restrictions on certain Byzantine 
Ecclesiastical and Ritual Ethnological Material from Cyprus. Under T.D. 
99-35, Sec. 12.104g(b) (19 CFR 12.104g(b)) of the regulations 
pertaining to emergency import restrictions was amended accordingly. 
This emergency protection was extended in CBP Dec. 03-25 (68 FR 51903, 
August 29, 2003). The ethnological material protected by the emergency 
restrictions was not covered by the 2002 bilateral agreement and the 
2002 Treasury Decision.
    On August 17, 2006, the Republic of Cyprus and the United States 
amended the bilateral agreement of July 16, 2002, to include the list 
of Byzantine Ecclesiastical and Ritual Ethnological Material from 
Cyprus that was protected pursuant to the emergency action. The 
amendment of the bilateral agreement to include this material was 
reflected in CBP Dec. 06-22, which was published in the Federal 
Register (71 FR 51724) on August 31, 2006. CBP Dec. 06-22 set forth the 
list of Byzantine Ecclesiastical and Ritual Ethnological Material from 
Cyprus that was previously protected pursuant to emergency action and 
announced that import restrictions were now imposed on this cultural 
property pursuant to the amended bilateral agreement. The amended 
bilateral agreement is set to expire on July 16, 2007, unless extended 
by the Parties.
    After reviewing the findings and recommendations of the Cultural 
Property Advisory Committee, the Assistant Secretary for Educational 
and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, concluding 
that the cultural heritage of Cyprus continues to be in jeopardy from 
pillage of certain archaeological objects and ethnological materials, 
made the necessary determination to extend the import restrictions on 
all the cultural property encompassed by the amended bilateral 
agreement for an additional five years on May 30, 2007. In addition to 
all the previously protected cultural material, import restrictions are 
also being imposed on a new subcategory of objects (Coins). 
Accordingly, CBP is amending 19 CFR 12.104g(a) to reflect the extension 
of the import restrictions on the currently protected cultural property 
as well as the new subcategory.
    The Designated List of articles that are protected pursuant to the 
bilateral agreement, as extended, on Pre-Classical and Classical 
Archaeological Objects and Byzantine Period Ecclesiastical and Ritual 
Ethnological Material from Cyprus has been revised and is published 
below. We note that the subcategory Coins of Cypriot Types has been 
added to the category entitled Metal, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2604. This 
addition comes in response to a request from the Government of the 
Republic of Cyprus to amend the Designated List. Coins constitute an 
inseparable part of the archaeological record of the island, and, like 
other archaeological objects, they are vulnerable to pillage and 
illicit export.

Century A.D. Through the 15th Century A.D.

I. Metal

A. Bronze
    Ceremonial objects include crosses, censers (incense burners), 
rings, and buckles for ecclesiastical garments. The objects may be 
decorated with engraved or modeled designs or Greek inscriptions. 
Crosses, rings and buckles are often set with semi-precious stones.
B. Lead
    Lead objects date to the Byzantine period and include ampulla 
(small bottle-shaped forms) used in religious observance.
C. Silver and Gold
    Ceremonial vessels and objects used in ritual and as components of 
church treasure. Ceremonial objects include censers (incense burners), 
book covers, liturgical crosses, archbishop's crowns, buckles, and 
chests. These are often decorated with molded or incised geometric 
motifs or scenes from the Bible, and encrusted with semi-precious or 
precious stones. The gems themselves may be engraved with religious 
figures or inscriptions. Church treasure may include all of the above, 
as well as rings, earrings, and necklaces (some decorated with 
ecclesiastical themes) and other implements (e.g., spoons).

II. Wood

    Artifacts made of wood are primarily those intended for ritual or 
ecclesiastical use during the Byzantine period. These include painted 
icons, painted wood screens (iconstasis), carved doors, crosses, 
painted wooded beams from churches or monasteries, thrones, chests and 
musical instruments. Religious figures (Christ, the Apostles, the 
Virgin, and others) predominate in the painted and carved figural 
decoration. Ecclesiastical furniture and architectural elements may 
also be decorated with geometric or floral designs.

III. Ivory and Bone

    Ecclesiastical and ritual objects of ivory and bone boxes, plaques, 
pendants, candelabra, stamp rings, crosses. Carved and engraved 
decoration includes religious figures, scenes from the Bible, and 
floral and geometric designs.

IV. Glass

    Ecclesiastical objects such as lamps and ritual vessels.

V. Textiles--Ritual Garments

    Ecclesiastical garments and other ritual textiles from the 
Byzantine period. Robes, vestments and altar clothes are often of a 
fine fabric and richly embroidered in silver and gold. Embroidered 
designs include religious motifs and floral and geometric designs.

VI. Stone

A. Wall Mosaics
    Dating to the Byzantine period, wall mosaics are found in 
ecclesiastical buildings. These generally portray images of Christ, 
Archangels, and the Apostles in scenes of Biblical events. Surrounding 
panels may contain animal, floral, or geometric designs.
B. Floor Mosaics
    Floor mosaics from ecclesiastical contexts. Examples include the 
mosaics at Nea Paphos, Kourion, Kouklia, Chrysopolitissa Basilica and 
Campanopetra Basilica. Floor mosaics may have animal, floral, geometric 
designs, or inscriptions.

VII. Frescoes/Wall Paintings

    Wall paintings from the Byzantine period religious structures 
(churches, monasteries, chapels, etc.) Like the mosaics, wall paintings 
generally portray images of Christ, Archangels, and the Apostles in 
scenes of Biblical events. Surrounding paintings may contain animal, 
floral, or geometric designs.
    More information on import restrictions can be obtained from the 
International Cultural Property Protection Web site (<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop">http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop</A>
). The restrictions on the importation of 

these archaeological and ethnological materials from Cyprus are to 
continue in effect for an additional 5 years. Importation of such 
materials continues to be restricted unless the conditions set forth in 
19 U.S.C. 2606 and 19 CFR 12.104c are met.

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public procedure 
(5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). For the same reason, a delayed effective date is 
not required.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply.

Executive Order 12866

    Because this rule involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States, it is not subject to Executive Order 12866.

Signing Authority

    This regulation is being issued in accordance with 19 CFR 
0.1(a)(1).

List of Subjects in 19 CFR Part 12
