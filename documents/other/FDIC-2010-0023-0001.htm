RIN 3064-AD55

Assets Transferred by an Insured Depository Institution in Connection 
With a Securitization or Participation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is correcting 
a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register of March 18, 2010 
(75 FR 12962). The final rule added a new provision in order to 
continue for a limited time the safe harbor provision for 
securitizations that would be affected by recent changes to generally 
accepted accounting principles. In effect, the Final Rule permanently 
``grandfathers'' all securitizations for which financial assets were 
transferred or, for revolving trusts, for which securities were issued 
prior to September 30, 2010 so long as those securitizations complied 
with the

preexisting requirements under generally accepted accounting principles 
in effect prior to November 15, 2009.

DATES: Effective March 18, 2010.

Chairman, 202-898- 8950; George Alexander, Division of Resolutions and 
Receiverships, 202 898-3718; or R. Penfield Starke, Legal Division, 
703-562-2422, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street,

    3. On page 12965, the amendatory language statement is corrected to
