SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background

    The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) (12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.) is 
intended to encourage insured depository institutions to help meet the 
credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income 
neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operation of the 
institutions. The CRA requires each of the agencies to use its 
authority when examining financial institutions to encourage such 
institutions to help meet the credit needs of the local communities 
they are chartered to serve. The agencies are required to consider this 
record in evaluating an application for a charter, deposit insurance, 
branch or other deposit facility, office relocation, merger, or holding 
company acquisition of an insured depository institution. Detailed 
information on CRA regulations and Interagency Examination Procedures 
are available on the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council 
(FFIEC) Web site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.ffiec.gov/cra/default.htm">http://www.ffiec.gov/cra/default.htm</A>.

Public Hearings

    The purpose of the public hearings is to receive public comments on 
the agencies' CRA regulations and to solicit views on whether and how 
the agencies should revise their CRA regulations to better serve the 
goals of the CRA. The agencies invite testimony (oral and written) on 
any issues regarding the

[[Page 35688]]

CRA from any interested person.\1\ While the agencies recognize public 
comments may discuss matters requiring statutory changes, the agencies' 
focus is on potential regulatory changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ These hearings do not fall under the Negotiated Rulemaking 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 561 et seq., or the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 
U.S.C. Appendix 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To participate in or attend the hearings in person, registration is 
required at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.ffiec.gov/cra/hearings.htm">http://www.ffiec.gov/cra/hearings.htm</A> and must be completed 
at least five (5) business days before the hearing date. Individuals 
proposing to testify are also strongly encouraged to provide their 
written testimony at the time of registration. The time available for 
presentations and the space in the meeting rooms is limited. Depending 
on the number of requests, the agencies may not be able to accommodate 
all who desire to speak or attend. In that case, the agencies will 
establish a waiting list. By providing an email address and daytime 
telephone number, you will enable us to confirm your participation and 
arrange security clearance.
    The hearings will address the broad range of CRA issues listed 
below under Topics and Questions, as well as other CRA issues that may 
be suggested by participants. Individuals requesting to participate in 
the hearings should indicate to the agencies the primary topics they 
intend to cover. The agencies will organize panels of presenters who 
will have five minutes to make opening remarks. Representatives of the 
regulatory agencies will then ask questions of the panelists. In 
addition, there will be an opportunity for other participants to 
deliver oral statements of three minutes or less. While all of the 
topics will be open for discussion at all of the hearings, the agencies 
plan to organize panels that will include invited participants, to 
focus on particular topics in particular hearing locations. Panels are 
being considered in the hearing locations as noted below:
    <bullet> Arlington: Community Development; Ratings and Incentives; 
Effect of Evidence of Discriminatory or Other Illegal Credit Practices 
on CRA Performance Evaluations.
    <bullet> Atlanta: Access to Banking Services (focus on serving both 
unbanked and under-banked individuals and distressed and underserved 
areas; Revisions to CRA Performance Tests (focus on rural communities 
and small institutions).
    <bullet> Chicago: Geographic Coverage; Affiliate Activities; 
Revisions to CRA Performance Tests.
    <bullet> Los Angeles: Small Business and Consumer Lending; CRA Data 
Collection, Reporting and Disclosure, and Performance Evaluations.
    Oral presentations will be limited to the time available. Potential 
presenters are, therefore, strongly encouraged to make their written 
testimony available to the agencies five business days in advance of 
the hearing to provide additional information and help facilitate the 
question period. Hearing proceedings will be recorded.
    Details on the agendas of the specific hearings will be made 
available on the registration Web site. Confirmations will also be 
provided to the hearing presenters by email by an agency contact.

Written Comments

    As noted above, individuals are invited and encouraged to submit 
written comments addressing their views on the CRA regulation, whether 
or not they plan to participate in the hearings. Persons wishing to 
provide written comments (other than testimony) may submit them as 
provided above through August 31, 2010.

Topics and Questions

    The agencies are particularly interested in receiving hearing 
testimony and written comments on the following topics and questions:
    Geographic coverage. What are the best approaches to evaluating the 
geographic scope of depository institution lending, investment and/or 
deposit-taking activities under CRA? Should geographic scope differ for 
institutions that are traditional branch-based retail institutions 
compared to institutions with limited or no physical deposit-taking 
facilities? Should it differ for small local institutions compared to 
institutions with a nationwide customer base? If so, how? As the 
financial services industry continues to evolve and uses new 
technologies to serve customers, how should the agencies adapt their 
CRA evaluations of urban and rural communities?
    CRA performance tests, asset thresholds and designations. Should 
the agencies revise the criteria used to assess performance under the 
current CRA tests: Small institution; intermediate small institution; 
large institution; wholesale and limited purpose institution or 
strategic plan? Are the current asset thresholds that apply to 
institutions and tests appropriate?
    Affiliate activities. Currently, the agencies consider affiliate 
activities only at the request of the related depository institution. 
Should the agencies revise the regulation and, instead, require that 
examiners routinely consider activities by affiliates? If so, what 
affiliates or activities should be reviewed? How should consideration 
of affiliates affect the geographic coverage of CRA assessments?
    Small business and consumer lending evaluations and data. Should 
the agencies revise the evaluation of and/or data requirements for 
small business and small farm lending activities or for consumer 
lending activities, including activities or products designed to meet 
the needs of low- and moderate-income consumers? If so, what changes 
are needed?
    Access to banking services. How should access to financial services 
be considered under CRA? What changes would encourage financial 
institutions to expand access to un-banked and under-banked consumers 
in a safe and sound manner and to promote affordable, safe transaction 
and savings accounts? Should the agencies revise CRA to include 
additional regulatory incentives to provide access to services for 
historically underserved and distressed areas?
    Community development. What are the opportunities to better 
encourage community development loans, investments and services to 
support projects that have a significant impact on a neighborhood? 
Should the agencies consider revisions to the Community Development 
Test or to the definition of community development? How could the rules 
most effectively balance support for community development 
organizations of different sizes, varying geographic scope, and in 
diverse rural and urban communities? How might they balance incentives 
for meeting local needs as well as the needs of very distressed areas 
or those with emergency conditions?
    Ratings and incentives. Is there an opportunity to improve the 
rules governing CRA ratings to differentiate strong, mediocre, and 
inadequate CRA performance more consistently and effectively? Are there 
more effective measures to assess the qualitative elements of an 
institution's performance? Are there regulatory incentives that could 
be considered to encourage and recognize those institutions with 
superior CRA performance?
    Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit 
practices on CRA Performance Evaluations. Currently, the agencies' 
evaluations of CRA performance are adversely affected by evidence of 
discriminatory or other illegal credit practices as outlined in the

[[Page 35689]]

CRA rules. Are the existing standards adequate? Should the regulations 
require the agencies to consider violations of additional consumer 
laws, such as the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer 
Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act? Should the regulations be 
revised to more specifically address how evidence of unsafe and unsound 
lending practices adversely affects CRA ratings?
    CRA disclosures and Performance Evaluations. Should the agencies 
consider changes to data collection, reporting, and disclosure 
requirements, for example, on community development loans and 
investments? What changes to public Performance Evaluations would 
streamline the reports, simplify compliance, improve consistency and 
enhance clarity? Should the agencies consider changes to how 
Performance Evaluations incorporate information from community contacts 
or public comments?
