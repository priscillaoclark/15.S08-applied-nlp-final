SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 
3201 et seq.) (Interlocks Act or Act) prohibits individuals from 
simultaneously serving as a

[[Page 38754]]

management official \1\ at two unaffiliated depository institutions or 
their holding companies (collectively, depository organizations) under 
certain circumstances. For example, section 203(1) of the Act (12 
U.S.C. 3202(1)) prohibits interlocks between unaffiliated depository 
organizations if each depository organization (or a depository 
institution affiliate thereof) has an office in the same relevant 
metropolitan statistical area (RMSA) (RMSA prohibition), unless one of 
the depository organizations involved has total assets below a 
specified threshold (small institution exception). Prior to enactment 
of the FSRRA, the total asset threshold for this small institution 
exception was $20 million. However, section 610 of the FSRRA amended 
section 203(1) of the Interlocks Act by raising this asset threshold to 
$50 million, effective as of October 13, 2006.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Each of the Agencies' regulations generally define 
``management official'' to include a director, an advisory or 
honorary director of a depository institution with total assets of 
$100 million or more, a senior executive officer, a branch manager, 
a trustee of a depository organization under the control of 
trustees, and any person who has a representative or nominee serving 
in such capacity. See 12 CFR 26.2(j) (OCC); 12 CFR 212.2(j) (Board); 
12 CFR 348.2(j) (FDIC); and 12 CFR 563f.2(j) (OTS).
    \2\ Pub. L. 109-351, section 610, 120 Stat. 1966 (Oct. 13, 
2006).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Summary of Interim Rule

    In January 2007, the Agencies adopted on an interim basis, and 
requested public comment on, amendments to their rules in order to 
implement section 610 of the FSRRA.\3\ Specifically, the interim rules 
modified the regulatory RMSA prohibition to conform to revised section 
203(1) of the Act by allowing a management official of one depository 
organization to serve as a management official of an unaffiliated 
depository organization if the depository organizations (or their 
depository institution affiliates) have offices in the same RMSA and 
one of the depository organizations in question has total assets of 
less than $50 million.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See 72 FR 1274, Jan. 11, 2007.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The interim rule also made technical changes to correct inaccurate 
cross-references in the definition of management official in each of 
the Agencies' rules.

III. Explanation of Final Rule

    The Agencies received two comments on the interim rule, both of 
which were filed by trade associations representing banking 
organizations. Both commenters supported the interim rule, stating that 
the rule will afford small banking organizations greater access to 
qualified individuals who may serve as management officials. Both 
commenters also urged the Agencies to consider further raising the 
asset threshold for the small institution exception to the RMSA 
prohibition. As noted in the interim rule, FSRRA raised the asset 
threshold, and neither FSRRA nor the Act gives the Agencies discretion 
to modify the asset-size threshold for the small institution exception. 
After carefully considering the comments received, the Agencies have 
adopted a final rule that is identical to the interim rule.

IV. Regulatory Analysis

Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 4809) requires 
the Agencies to use ``plain language'' in all rules published in the 
Federal Register after January 1, 2000. The Agencies believe the final 
rule is presented in a simple and straightforward manner.

Administrative Procedure Act

    The final rule takes effect upon publication in the Federal 
Register. As noted in the interim rule, the changes adopted in the rule 
implement a statutory change that took effect upon enactment on October 
13, 2006, and the technical corrections of cross-references effected by 
the rule are not substantive. The new statutory provision itself gives 
the Agencies no discretion to modify the asset-size threshold for the 
small institution exception. Accordingly, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d), 
the agencies conclude that there is good cause for making this rule 
effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
(5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the regulatory flexibility analysis otherwise 
required under section 603 of the RFA (5 U.S.C. 603) is not required if 
the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
and the agency publishes such certification and a statement explaining 
the factual basis for such certification in the Federal Register along 
with its rule.
    Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, each of the Agencies 
certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Agencies expect 
that this rule will not create any additional burden on small entities. 
The final rule relaxes the criteria for obtaining an exemption from the 
RMSA prohibition, and specifically addresses the needs of small 
entities by allowing greater numbers of small organizations to qualify 
for the small institution exception from the RMSA prohibition. 
Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
3506; 5 CFR 1320 Appendix A.1), the Agencies have determined that no 
collections of information pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act are 
contained in the final rule.

OCC and OTS Executive Order 12866 Statement

    The OCC and OTS each have independently determined that the final 
rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined in Executive 
Order 12866. Accordingly, a regulatory assessment is not required.

OCC and OTS Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995 Statement

    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1532), requires the OCC and OTS to prepare a budgetary impact statement 
before promulgating a rule that includes a federal mandate that may 
result in the expenditure by state, local, and tribal governments, in 
the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any 
one year. However, this requirement does not apply to regulations that 
incorporate requirements specifically set forth in law. Because this 
final rule implements section 610 of the FSRRA, the OTS and OCC have 
not conducted an Unfunded Mandates Analysis for this rulemaking.
