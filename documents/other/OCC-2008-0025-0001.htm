SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision 
(OTS) (collectively, the Agencies) are amending their regulatory 
capital rules to permit banks, bank holding companies, and savings 
associations (collectively, banking organizations) to reduce the amount 
of goodwill that a banking organization must deduct from tier 1 capital 
by the amount of any deferred tax liability associated with that 
goodwill. For a banking organization that elects to apply this final 
rule, the amount of goodwill the banking organization must deduct from 
tier 1 capital would reflect the maximum exposure to loss in the event 
that such goodwill is impaired or derecognized for financial reporting 
purposes.

[[Page 79603]]


DATES: Effective date: This rule is effective January 29, 2009.
    Applicability date: Banking organizations may elect to apply this 
final rule for purposes of the regulatory reporting period ending on 
December 31, 2008.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    Under the Agencies' existing risk-based and leverage capital rules, 
a banking organization \1\ must deduct certain assets from tier 1 
capital.\2\ A banking organization is permitted to net any associated 
deferred tax liability against some of those assets prior to making the 
deduction from tier 1 capital. Included among the assets eligible for 
this netting treatment are certain intangible assets arising from a 
nontaxable business combination. Such netting generally is not 
permitted for goodwill and other intangible assets arising from a 
taxable business combination. In these cases, the full or gross 
carrying amount of the asset is deducted.
    On September 30, 2008, the Agencies published a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (the proposal or NPR) in the Federal Register that would 
permit a banking organization to reduce the amount of goodwill arising 
from a taxable business combination that it must deduct from tier 1 
capital by the amount of any deferred tax liability associated with 
that goodwill.\3\ The Board, OCC, and OTS also proposed revisions to 
their respective capital rules that were intended to conform certain 
provisions of their rules to developments in generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP), clarify certain definitions and related 
provisions, and present the rule text in a manner that is consistent 
across the Agencies. The Agencies requested comment on all aspects of 
the proposal and whether to extend the proposed capital treatment for 
any deferred tax liability associated with goodwill to deferred tax 
liabilities associated with other intangible assets acquired in a 
taxable business combination.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Unless otherwise indicated, the term ``banking 
organization'' includes banks, savings associations, and bank 
holding companies (BHCs). The terms ``bank holding company'' and 
``BHC'' refer only to bank holding companies regulated by the Board.
    \2\ See the Agencies' capital rules for more detail on what 
assets are required to be deducted from regulatory capital and how 
these deductions are calculated. See 12 CFR part 3 (national banks); 
12 CFR part 208 (state member banks); 12 CFR part 225 (bank holding 
companies); 12 CFR part 325 (state nonmember banks); and 12 CFR part 
567 (savings associations). This final rule is focused on the 
deduction of goodwill from tier 1 capital.
    \3\ See 73 FR 56756 (September 30, 2008).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Comments

    The Agencies received 13 public comments on the proposal from 
banking organizations, industry associations, and other parties. The 
majority of the commenters supported the proposal. Five of the 
commenters who supported the proposal encouraged the Agencies to adopt 
the final rule so that it could be applicable for regulatory capital 
reporting purposes as of December 31, 2008. The Agencies agree and are 
permitting banking organizations to elect to apply the rule for 
purposes of the regulatory reporting period ending on December 31, 
2008.
    The Agencies note that the NPR requested comment and solicited data 
on the capital impact of potentially extending the proposed rule to 
intangible assets other than goodwill acquired in a taxable business 
combination. Although several commenters submitted general requests to 
extend the capital treatment proposed for goodwill to other intangible 
assets, they did not provide quantitative data to support broadening 
the scope of the proposal. In the absence of any supportive analyses, 
the Agencies have decided not to broaden the scope of the rule.
    Two commenters noted that the proposed rule either would or should 
permit the inclusion of goodwill in regulatory capital. The Agencies 
are prohibited by law from permitting a banking organization to include 
goodwill in regulatory capital.\4\ The Agencies note that this final 
rule continues to require a banking organization to deduct goodwill 
from tier 1 capital.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See 12 U.S.C. 1828(n).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As several commenters stated, if goodwill becomes impaired or is 
derecognized under GAAP, a banking organization's maximum exposure to 
loss is equal to the carrying value of the goodwill less any associated 
deferred tax liability. The Agencies agree with commenters that, unlike 
most other liabilities, a deferred tax liability associated with 
goodwill does not represent a claim on or interest in the cash or 
assets of the organization. For these reasons, the Agencies believe 
that it is appropriate to permit a banking organization to reduce the 
amount of goodwill it must deduct from tier 1 capital by the amount of 
any associated deferred tax liability, that is, the amount that 
reflects the banking organization's maximum exposure to loss if such 
goodwill becomes impaired or derecognized under GAAP.
    One commenter disagreed with the calculation of the maximum capital 
reduction that could occur as a result of the impairment of goodwill in 
the example in the NPR. This commenter asserted that the maximum 
capital reduction under GAAP should be equal to the carrying value of 
goodwill less the sum of tax benefits recognized as of the date of 
impairment and those tax benefits to be realized in future periods. The 
Agencies believe that current rules adequately address the treatment of 
deferred tax assets for regulatory capital purposes and that deferred 
tax assets that may be created for tax benefits to be realized in the 
future are beyond the scope of this NPR. One commenter expressed 
concern about the tax rate used in the example in the NPR. The Agencies 
emphasize that the tax rate in the example was simply an assumption for 
illustrative purposes.
    Two commenters opposed the proposal. One expressed general 
opposition to any rule that would reduce the regulatory capital 
requirements for banking organizations.

[[Page 79604]]

Another commenter urged the Agencies to withdraw the proposal in light 
of other efforts by the Federal government to provide capital support 
to the financial services industry. Alternatively, if the Agencies did 
not withdraw the proposal, this commenter requested an extension of the 
comment period to address valuation issues. Further, this commenter 
criticized the proposal as an attempt to provide artificial capital 
support to certain banking organizations. In addition, several 
commenters that supported the proposal raised questions about the 
valuation of goodwill. The Agencies believe that the rule as proposed 
achieves consistency with GAAP for regulatory reporting purposes and 
for determining the carrying amount of both goodwill and deferred tax 
liabilities.

III. Final Rule

    After reviewing the comments, the Agencies have adopted the 
proposal without change. Under the final rule, a banking organization 
may reduce the amount of goodwill that it must deduct from tier 1 
capital by the amount of any deferred tax liability associated with 
that goodwill. However, a banking organization that reduces the amount 
of goodwill deducted from tier 1 capital by the amount of the deferred 
tax liability is not permitted to net this deferred tax liability 
against deferred tax assets when determining regulatory capital 
limitations on deferred tax assets. For these banking organizations, 
the amount of goodwill deducted from tier 1 capital will reflect each 
organization's maximum exposure to loss in the event that the entire 
amount of goodwill is impaired or derecognized, an event which triggers 
the concurrent derecognition of the related deferred tax liability for 
financial reporting purposes.

IV. Other Revisions

    As discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, the OCC is 
consolidating the various provisions permitting a bank to deduct assets 
from tier 1 capital on a basis net of any associated deferred tax 
liability together in one section of the regulatory text to make it 
easier to locate. The OCC is also clarifying the current regulatory 
text's special treatment of intangible assets acquired due to a 
nontaxable purchase business combination. In addition, the OCC is 
replacing the term ``purchased mortgage servicing rights'' with the 
broader term ``servicing assets,'' making clarifying changes to more 
accurately reflect the OCC's existing interpretation of the current 
regulatory text, amending the definition of goodwill to conform to 
GAAP, and making other technical and miscellaneous changes to its 
regulatory capital rules. No comments were received on these 
amendments. The amendments are adopted by the OCC as proposed. However, 
existing regulatory text not printed in the proposal has been added at 
section 2(c) for ease of reader reference to clarify that goodwill is 
required to be deducted from tier 1 capital.
    The Board is adopting as final the non-substantive technical 
changes proposed in the NPR that conform the definition of goodwill in 
its regulatory capital rules to GAAP. Further, the Board is amending 
Appendix A to 12 CFR part 225 to remove obsolete text that relates to 
goodwill recognized by a BHC prior to December 31, 1992. The Board 
received no comments on its proposal to make these rule changes.
    OTS is adopting as final the changes to its capital regulations as 
proposed in the NPR as follows: First, OTS is amending its definition 
of ``intangible assets'' in 12 CFR 567.1 and 12 CFR 567.9 to reference 
servicing assets as intangible assets. Second, OTS is conforming its 
regulatory text to that of the other Agencies to provide for netting a 
deferred tax liability specifically related to certain intangible 
assets against those intangible assets, prior to deduction when 
calculating regulatory capital, and to add regulatory text addressing 
the regulatory capital limitation on deferred tax assets. In addition, 
OTS is amending its definition in 12 CFR 565.2(f) and other proposed 
regulatory text in 12 CFR 567.9(c)(1) to conform with changes in this 
rule.

Effective Date and Applicability Date

    This final rule takes effect 30 days after publication in the 
Federal Register. In response to requests from commenters, the Agencies 
are permitting banking organizations to elect to apply this final rule 
for purposes of the regulatory reporting period ending on December 31, 
2008.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires an agency that is 
issuing a final rule to provide a final regulatory flexibility analysis 
or to certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See 5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 5 U.S.C. 605(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under regulations issued by the Small Business Administration,\6\ a 
small entity includes a bank holding company, commercial bank, or 
savings association with assets of $175 million or less (collectively, 
small banking organizations).\7\ This final rule would in effect permit 
a banking organization to compute its deduction from regulatory capital 
of goodwill net of any associated deferred tax liability. The Agencies 
believe that this final rule will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities because the final rule 
is elective and, thus, does not require a banking organization to 
compute its deduction from regulatory capital of goodwill net of any 
associated deferred tax liability. In addition, the Agencies did not 
receive any comments that the proposal would have a significant impact 
on small banking organizations. Accordingly, each of the Agencies 
certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See 13 CFR 121.201.
    \7\ As of June 30, 2008, there were approximately 2,636 small 
bank holding companies, 730 small national banks, 467 small state 
member banks, 3,222 small state nonmember banks, and 412 small 
savings associations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the 
Agencies reviewed the rule regarding the treatment of a deferred tax 
liability attributable to goodwill as required by the Office of 
Management and Budget.\8\ No collections of information pursuant to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act are contained in the rule. However, 
implementation of this rule will require certain clarifying revisions 
to the instructions for the Agencies' quarterly regulatory reports \9\ 
to reflect the change in a banking organization's tier 1 capital.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See 44 U.S.C. 3506; 5 CFR 1320 Appendix A.1.

Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-9C) (OMB No. 7100-0128).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the Agencies to 
use plain language in all proposed and final rules published after 
January 1, 2000. In light of this requirement, the Agencies have sought 
to present the rule in a simple and straightforward manner.

OCC and OTS Executive Order 12866 Determinations

    Executive Order 12866 requires Federal agencies to prepare a 
regulatory impact analysis for agency actions that are found to be 
significant regulatory actions. Significant regulatory actions include, 
among other things, rulemakings that have an annual effect

[[Page 79605]]

on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a 
material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, 
local, or tribal governments or communities. The OCC and OTS each have 
determined that its portion of the rule is not a significant regulatory 
action.

OCC and OTS Executive Order 13132 Determinations

    The OCC and OTS each determined that its portion of the rulemaking 
does not have any federalism implications for purposes of Executive 
Order 13132.

OCC and OTS Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 Determinations

    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA)\10\ 
requires that an agency prepare a budgetary impact statement before 
promulgating a rule that includes a Federal mandate that may result in 
the expenditure by state, local, and tribal governments, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector of $100 million or more (adjusted 
annually for inflation) in any one year.\11\ If a budgetary impact 
statement is required, section 205 of the UMRA also requires an agency 
to identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives 
before promulgating a rule.\12\ The OCC and OTS each have determined 
that its rule will not result in expenditures by state, local, and 
tribal governments, or by the private sector, of $133 million or more. 
Accordingly, neither OCC nor OTS has prepared a budgetary impact 
statement or specifically addressed the regulatory alternatives 
considered.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See 2 U.S.C. 1532.
    \11\ The OCC and OTS adjusted $100 million for inflation using 
the GDP implicit price deflator with the second quarter of 1995 as 
the base index. The result was $132.64 million, which OCC and OTS 
rounded to $133 million.

tax liabilities netted in this manner cannot also be netted against 
deferred tax assets when determining the amount of deferred tax 
assets that are dependent upon future taxable income.
    f. Valuation. Banks must review the book value of goodwill and 
other intangible assets at least quarterly and make adjustments to 
these values as necessary. The fair value of mortgage servicing 
assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card 
relationships, and credit-enhancing I/Os also must be determined at 
least quarterly. This determination shall include adjustments for 
any significant changes in original valuation assumptions, including 
changes in prepayment estimates or account attrition rates. 
Examiners will review both the book value and the fair value 
assigned to these assets, together with supporting documentation, 
during the examination process. In addition, the Federal Reserve may 
require, on a case-by-case basis, an independent valuation of a 
bank's goodwill, other intangible assets, or credit-enhancing I/Os.

    a. Goodwill. Goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the 
excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts 
assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is 
deducted from the sum of core capital elements in determining tier 1 
capital.
* * * * *
    e. * * *
    iii. Bank holding companies may elect to deduct goodwill, 
disallowed mortgage servicing assets, disallowed nonmortgage 
servicing assets, and disallowed credit-enhancing I/Os (both 
purchased and retained) on a basis that is net of any associated 
deferred tax liability. Deferred tax liabilities netted in this 
manner cannot also be netted against deferred tax assets when 
determining the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent 
upon future taxable income.
    f. Valuation. Bank holding companies must review the book value 
of goodwill and other intangible assets at least quarterly and make 
adjustments to these values as necessary. The fair value of mortgage 
servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, purchased credit 
card relationships, and credit-enhancing I/Os also must be 
determined at least quarterly. This determination shall include 
adjustments for any significant changes in original valuation 
assumptions, including changes in prepayment estimates or account 
attrition rates. Examiners will review both the book value and the 
fair value assigned to these assets, together with supporting 
documentation, during the inspection process. In addition, the 
Federal Reserve may require, on a case-by-case basis, an independent 
valuation of a bank holding company's goodwill, other intangible 
assets, or credit-enhancing I/Os.

    (5) Goodwill and other intangible assets. This paragraph (g)(5) 
provides the capital treatment for intangible assets acquired in a 
nontaxable business combination, and goodwill acquired in a taxable 
business combination.
    (i) Intangible assets acquired in nontaxable purchase business 
combinations. A deferred tax liability that is specifically related to 
an intangible asset (other than mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage 
servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships) acquired in 
a nontaxable purchase business combination may be netted against this 
intangible asset. Only the net amount of this intangible asset must be 
deducted from Tier 1 capital.
    (ii) Goodwill acquired in a taxable purchase business combination. 
A deferred tax liability that is specifically related to goodwill 
acquired in a taxable purchase business combination may be netted 
against this goodwill. Only the net amount of this goodwill must be 
deducted from Tier 1 capital.
    (iii) Treatment of a netted deferred tax liability. When a deferred 
tax liability is netted in accordance with paragraph (g)(5)(i) or (ii) 
of this section, the taxable temporary difference that gives rise to 
this deferred tax liability must be excluded from existing taxable 
temporary differences when determining the amount of deferred tax

    (iv) Valuation. The FDIC in its discretion may require independent

Sec.  567.12  Purchased credit card relationships, servicing assets, 
intangible assets (other than purchased credit card relationships and 
servicing assets), credit-enhancing interest-only strips, and deferred 
tax assets.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the maximum amount of purchased 
credit card relationships, serving assets, intangible assets (other 
than purchased credit card relationships and servicing assets), credit-
enhancing interest-only strips, and deferred tax assets that savings 
associations may include in calculating tangible and core capital.
    (b) * * *
    (3) Intangible assets, as defined in Sec.  567.1 of this part, 
other than purchased credit card relationships described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, servicing assets described in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, and core deposit intangibles described in paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section, are deducted in computing tangible and core 
capital, subject to paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.
* * * * *
    (5) Deferred tax assets may be included (that is not deducted) in 
computing core capital subject to the restrictions of paragraph (h) of 
this section, and may be included in tangible capital in the same 
amount.
* * * * *
    (e) * * *
    (3) Computation. (i) For purposes of computing the limits and 
sublimits in paragraphs (e) and (h) of this section, core capital is 
computed before the deduction of disallowed servicing assets, 
disallowed purchased credit card relationships, disallowed credit-
enhancing interest-only strips (purchased and retained), and disallowed 
deferred tax assets.
    (ii) A savings association may elect to deduct the following items 
on a basis net of deferred tax liabilities:
    (A) Disallowed servicing assets;
    (B) Goodwill such that only the net amount must be deducted from 
Tier 1 capital;
    (C) Disallowed credit-enhancing interest only strips (both 
purchased and retained); and
    (D) Other intangible assets arising from non-taxable business 
combinations. A deferred tax liability that is specifically related to 
an intangible asset (other than purchased credit card relationships) 
arising from a nontaxable business combination may be netted against 
this intangible asset. The net amount of the intangible asset must be 
deducted from Tier 1 capital.
    (iii) Deferred tax liabilities that are netted in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section cannot also be netted against 
deferred tax assets when determining the amount of deferred tax assets 
that are dependent upon future taxable income.
* * * * *
    (h) Treatment of deferred tax assets. For purposes of calculating 
Tier 1 capital under this part (but not for financial statement 
purposes) deferred tax assets are subject to the conditions, 
limitations, and restrictions described in this section.
    (1) Tier 1 capital limitations. (i) The maximum allowable amount of 
deferred tax assets net of any valuation allowance that are dependent 
upon future taxable income will be limited to the lesser of:
    (A) The amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon 
future taxable income that is expected to be realized within one year 
of the calendar quarter-end date, based on a projected future taxable 
income for that year; or
    (B) Ten percent of the amount of Tier 1 capital that exists before 
the deduction of any disallowed servicing assets, any

[[Page 79608]]

disallowed purchased credit card relationships, any disallowed credit-
enhancing interest-only strips, and any disallowed deferred tax assets.
    (ii) For purposes of this limitation, all existing temporary 
differences should be assumed to fully reverse at the calendar quarter-
end date. The recorded amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent 
upon future taxable income, net of any valuation allowance for deferred 
tax assets, in excess of this limitation will be deducted from assets 
and from equity capital for purposes of determining Tier 1 capital 
under this part. The amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized 
from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from the reversal of 
existing taxable temporary differences generally would not be deducted 
from assets and from equity capital.
    (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(1)(B)(ii) of this section, the 
amount of carryback potential that may be considered in calculating the 
amount of deferred tax assets that a savings association that is part 
of a consolidated group (for tax purposes) may include in Tier 1 
capital may not exceed the amount which the association could 
reasonably expect to have refunded by its parent.
    (2) Projected future taxable income. Projected future taxable 
income should not include net operating loss carryforwards to be used 
within one year of the most recent calendar quarter-end date or the 
amount of existing temporary differences expected to reverse within 
that year. Projected future taxable income should include the estimated 
effect of tax planning strategies that are expected to be implemented 
to realize tax carryforwards that will otherwise expire during that 
year. Future taxable income projections for the current fiscal year 
(adjusted for any significant changes that have occurred or are 
expected to occur) may be used when applying the capital limit at an 
interim calendar quarter-end date rather than preparing a new 
projection each quarter.
    (3) Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale debt 
securities. The deferred tax effects of any unrealized holding gains 
and losses on available-for-sale debt securities may be excluded from 
the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that are 
dependent upon future taxable income and the calculation of the maximum 
allowable amount of such assets. If these deferred tax effects are 
excluded, this treatment must be followed consistently over time.
