SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Overview

    In the last quarter of 2008, the FDIC issued interim rules on three
deposit-insurance related matters: (1) The temporary increase in the
SMDIA from $100,000 to $250,000; (2) revisions to the rules on
revocable trust accounts; and (3) revisions to the rules on mortgage
servicing accounts. In this final rule, the FDIC is amending its
insurance regulations to reflect Congress's extension of the temporary
increase in the SMDIA (from $100,000 to $250,000) through December 31,
2013, and finalizing the interim rules on revocable trust accounts and
mortgage servicing accounts. The four-year extension of the increase in
the SMDIA, which necessitates revisions to the deposit insurance
regulations and examples therein, also affords the FDIC with the
opportunity to now make technical amendments to the FDIC's
international banking regulations (12 CFR Part 347) to replace several
references therein to a ``$100,000'' benchmark with references to the
SMDIA, consistent with the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming
Amendments Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-173).

I. Extension of Temporary Increase in the SMDIA

Background

    The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 temporarily
increased the SMDIA from $100,000 to $250,000, effective October 3,
2008, through December 31, 2009.\1\ On October 17, 2008, the FDIC
adopted an interim rule amending its deposit insurance regulations to
reflect this temporary increase in the SMDIA.\2\ Subsequent to the
issuance of this interim rule, on May 20, 2009, the President signed
the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, which, among other
provisions, extended the temporary increase in the SMDIA from December
31, 2009 to December 31, 2013.\3\ After December 31, 2013, the SMDIA
will, by law, return to $100,000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Public Law 110-343 (Oct. 3, 2008).
    \2\ 73 FR 61658 (Oct. 17, 2008).
    \3\ Public Law 111-22 (May 20, 2009).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Final Rule

    The final rule amends the FDIC's deposit insurance rules (12 CFR
Part 330) to indicate that the increase in the SMDIA from $100,000 to
$250,000 is effective through December 31, 2013. In light of this long-
term extension of the SMDIA, the FDIC also has updated the deposit
insurance coverage examples provided in the insurance rules to reflect
$250,000 as the SMDIA. The FDIC believes this will help to avoid any
confusion that might result among depositors and financial institution
employees if the examples continue to employ the $100,000 SMDIA and
related numerical values.

II. Deposit Insurance Coverage of Revocable Trust Accounts

The Interim Revocable Trust Account Rule

    In September 2008, the FDIC issued an interim rule designed to make
the coverage rules for revocable trust accounts easier to understand
and apply.\4\ In particular, the interim rule eliminated the concept of
``qualifying beneficiaries.'' The elimination of the ``qualifying
beneficiary'' concept was intended to achieve greater fairness by
broadening the scope of eligible beneficiaries and facilitate deposit
insurance determinations on revocable trust accounts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 73 FR 56706 (Sept. 30, 2008).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Also, the interim rule provided a two-part deposit insurance
coverage calculation method for revocable trust accounts. Under the
rule, where a trust account owner has five times the SMDIA ($1,250,000)
or less in revocable trust accounts at one FDIC-insured institution,
the owner is insured up to the SMDIA ($250,000) per beneficiary--
without regard to the exact beneficial interest of each beneficiary in
the trust. For a revocable trust account owner with both more than
$1,250,000 and more than five different beneficiaries named in the
trust(s), the interim rule insures the owner for the greater of either:
$1,250,000, or the aggregate total of all the beneficiaries' actual
interests in the trust(s) limited to $250,000 for each beneficiary.
    In addition, the interim rule sought to simplify the application of
the deposit insurance rules to both life-estate interests and to
irrevocable trusts springing from a revocable trust. The interim rule
simplified the deposit insurance coverage rules to deem the value of
each life estate interest to be the SMDIA amount. Thus, for example,

[[Page 47712]]

where the owner creates a living trust account and provides a life
estate interest for the owner's spouse, in addition to specific
bequests to named beneficiaries, the spousal interest is deemed to be
the SMDIA.
    Another complication is presented when an irrevocable living trust
springs from a revocable trust upon the owner's death. Under the prior
rules, the coverage of the trust account often would decrease because
the FDIC's rules governing irrevocable trust accounts were stricter
than the rules governing revocable trust accounts.\5\ To prevent this
decrease in coverage, the interim rule provided that irrevocable trust
accounts would be governed by the same rules as revocable trust
accounts when the irrevocable trust is created through the death of the
owner (grantor) of a revocable living trust.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ For example, assume that account owner ``A'' establishes a
living trust that names three children as beneficiaries. Assume also
that the trust agreement specifies that the revocable trust shall
become an irrevocable trust upon the owner's (grantor's) death. In
this example, during the life of the owner, the insurance coverage
of an account in the name of the trust would be determined by
multiplying the number of beneficiaries (3) by the SMDIA ($250,000).
Thus, the account would be insured up to $750,000. Following the
death of the owner, however, the coverage would change because the
trust itself would change from a revocable trust to an irrevocable
trust. Under the prior rules, the coverage of an irrevocable trust
account would depend upon whether the interests of the beneficiaries
were contingent (for example, contingent upon graduating from
college or contingent upon the discretion of the trustee). Assuming
that all beneficial interests were contingent, the coverage of the
account would be $250,000. Thus, in this example, the coverage would
decrease from $750,000 to $250,000 following the death of the owner
(and following the expiration of the FDIC's six-month grace period).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, the interim rule solicited specific comment on the effect
that the revocable trust simplifications enunciated in the interim rule
might have on the Deposit Insurance Fund (``DIF'') reserve ratio.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The reserve ratio is determined by dividing the DIF fund
balance by the estimated insured deposits by the industry, 12 U.S.C.
1817(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FDIC solicited comment on all aspects of the interim rule, and
explicitly solicited comment on: (1) Whether the $1,250,000 threshold
is a proper benchmark for distinguishing coverage for revocable trust
owners based on the beneficial interests of the trust beneficiaries;
(2) whether the FDIC's irrevocable trust accounts rules should be
revised in order that all trusts are covered by similar rules; and (3)
what effect the interim rule will have on the level of insured
deposits.

Comments Received on the Interim Revocable Trust Rule

    The FDIC received eighteen comments on the interim rule for
revocable trust accounts. These comments included one from a large bank
trade association representing all types of banks, one from a bank
trade association representing community banks, and one from a smaller
trade association representing community and regional banks, and
thrifts, operating in one particular State. The FDIC also received
fourteen comments from private citizens and one comment from some
members of a national trade association for lawyers. Overall, these
comments were highly favorable.
    Eight commenters addressed the interim rule's overall goal of, and
success at achieving, simplification, and applauded the FDIC's efforts
to clarify the deposit insurance rules. One commenter advocated greater
clarity in the application of the revocable trust rule's coverage of
trust accounts with balances exceeding $1,250,000 and naming more than
five beneficiaries, and another generally asserted that the rule
contained ambiguities.
    With regard to specific issues within the interim rule, ten
commenters expressed strong support for the interim rule's deletion of
the former rule's ``qualifying beneficiary'' concept. One commenter
advocated that the effective date of this change be made retroactive to
an earlier point in time in order to provide favorable treatment to
depositors who had uninsured deposits in bank failures occurring in
early 2008. In response to the FDIC's specific solicitation of comment
on the interim rule's use of a $500,000 benchmark (presently
$1,250,000) for delineating separate deposit insurance treatment for
higher-dollar revocable trust interests, five commenters deemed this to
be a reasonable benchmark, although one advocated that the amount be
raised significantly. One commenter observed that because most owners
of a revocable trust account at an insured depository institution will
commonly fall below the benchmark, the interim rule's lower-dollar
coverage approach--that fails to distinguish unequal beneficial
interests--will simplify coverage.
    In response to the interim rule's specific solicitation of comment
regarding the Deposit Insurance Fund, one commenter suggested that it
is likely difficult to clearly determine whether the interim rule will
result in a net increase in the level of insured deposits. In short,
the commenter postulated that, while the increase in deposit insurance
limits and other changes made in the interim rule may permit more
deposits to be deemed ``insured,'' it may also be the case that the
rule's effect will be to simply permit depositors to leave higher
account sums at one insured depository institution instead of having to
spread such revocable trust deposits over multiple institutions.
    Four commenters expressly requested that the FDIC clarify the rules
regarding the proper manner of ``titling'' a payable-on-death (``POD'')
account in order to ensure that the revocable trust account funds are
fully insured. Specifically, one citizen commenter relayed that she had
received conflicting advice from numerous local banks as to whether or
not the title of her revocable trust POD account had to expressly
include the acronym ``POD,'' the phrase ``in trust for'' (``ITF''), or
whether it had to include the name of a beneficiary in the title,
either along with, or without, such acronyms. The commenter was unsure
whether current FDIC rules deem it sufficient that the other account
records at the depository institution contain this information. This
commenter advocated that the burden should not fall on the public to
learn and clarify the titling rules. Another commenter advocated
eliminating the requirement that the POD account title contain the POD/
ITF designation, and asserted that it should be sufficient that the
owner's account records at the bank reflect the beneficiaries. A third
commenter expressed the view that banks appear to take different
approaches to titling these accounts and recommended uniform rules to
address this titling issue. Two of these commenters suggested that some
banks' software does not easily permit the addition of ``POD'' or
``ITF'' to account titles. One bank trade association observed that the
purpose of the account titling requirement is to facilitate FDIC
staff's ability, at resolution, to quickly determine deposit insurance
eligibility, and asked whether a bank's utilization of a computer code
in the title to denote account ownership could be deemed sufficient to
meet the revocable trust account titling requirements. On a separate
titling issue, one commenter asked that the FDIC clarify that an owner
may, in naming a POD account, name a revocable trust as a beneficiary.
    The FDIC expressly solicited comment on whether the FDIC's
irrevocable trust account rules should be revised so that all trusts
are covered by substantially the same rules. Four comments addressed
the interim rule's continuing application of the revocable trust rules
to a living trust after the death of the owner (and notwithstanding the
fact that such trust converts to an irrevocable trust upon such event),
and all commented favorably. These commenters also urged that the
deposit insurance rules for

[[Page 47713]]

irrevocable and revocable trusts should be the same.
    One commenter also expressly advocated that the FDIC clarify that
when a ``sole proprietor'' is a named beneficiary, then the sole
proprietor is covered by the rule in his or her individual capacity.
Lastly, one commenter recommended that the definition of ``non-
contingent trust interest'' be expanded to include the interest of a
discretionary beneficiary and presumptive remainderman of a
discretionary trust.

The Final Revocable Trust Rule

    The final rule closely follows the interim rule, with minor
revisions. Notably, in light of the statutory extension of the
temporary increase in the SMDIA, the final rule reflects the new
$250,000 SMDIA, the new $1,250,000 benchmark for revocable trust
account coverage following this change, and revised examples employing
both of these dollar values and revised values for the hypothetical
sums within the examples to enhance their illustrative utility. We also
have provided additional examples illustrating how the revised rules
would apply. Pursuant to statute, December 31, 2013 is the ending date
for the $250,000 SMDIA, and after this date the SMDIA will revert to
$100,000. At that time the FDIC will revisit the need to revise these
limits and examples.
    In response to several specific questions raised by commenters
about the titling requirements for revocable trust accounts, clarifying
language has been incorporated into the final rule to address titling
of revocable trust accounts. Simply, the rule provides that, for
revocable trust accounts, ``title'' includes an insured depository
institution's electronic deposit account records. In addressing this
issue, the FDIC is retaining the requirement that the title of a
revocable trust account identify the account as such in order to
qualify for coverage under the revocable trust account rules; however,
the final rule clarifies that the FDIC will consider information in an
insured depository institution's electronic deposit account records to
determine if the titling requirement is satisfied. For example, the
FDIC would recognize an account as a revocable trust account even if
the account signature card does not designate the account as a
revocable trust account as long as the institution's electronic deposit
account records identify (through a code or otherwise) the account as a
revocable trust account.
    The final rule, like the interim rule, eliminates the concept of
``qualifying beneficiaries,'' and requires only that a revocable trust
beneficiary be a natural person, or a charity or other non-profit
organization. This change was universally applauded by commenters to
the interim rule. The final rule also incorporates the interim rule's
two-part calculation method for deposit insurance coverage of revocable
trust accounts. While, as a result of the temporary increase in the
SMDIA, the benchmark between the lower-dollar and higher-dollar
revocable trust deposit insurance treatments has increased to
$1,250,000 (from $500,000 as set forth in the originally-issued interim
rule), it is anticipated that the lower-balance treatment for revocable
trust ownership interests falling below $1,250,000 at one institution
will likely capture most revocable trust accounts, and this should
advance the FDIC's goals of simplifying the treatment of unequal
beneficial interests and quickening deposit insurance coverage
determinations. The deposit insurance coverage calculation method for
revocable trust ownership interests that are both above this $1,250,000
benchmark and involve more than five beneficiaries, consistent with the
interim rule, will ensure that reasonable limits remain on the maximum
coverage available to revocable trust account owners and avoid the
potential of unlimited coverage being afforded to such accounts through
contrived trust structures. Moreover, consistent with the interim rule,
where a POD account owner names his or her living trust as a
beneficiary of the POD account, for insurance purposes, the FDIC will
consider the beneficiaries of the trust to be the beneficiaries of the
POD account.

III. Mortgage Servicing Accounts

Background

    The FDIC's deposit insurance regulations include specific rules
addressing the deposit insurance coverage of payments collected by
mortgage servicers and deposited in accounts at insured depository
institutions (``mortgage servicing accounts''). 12 CFR 330.7(d).
Accounts maintained by mortgage servicers in a custodial or other
fiduciary capacity may include funds paid by mortgagors (borrowers) for
principal and interest, and may also include funds mortgagors advance
as amounts held for the payment of taxes and insurance premiums.
    Historically, under section 330.7(d), funds representing principal
and interest payments in a mortgage servicing account were insured for
the interest of each owner (mortgagee, investor or security holder) in
those accounts. On the other hand, funds maintained by a servicer in a
custodial or fiduciary capacity representing payments by mortgagors of
taxes and insurance premiums are added together and insured for the
ownership interest of each mortgagor in those accounts. Thus, funds
representing payments of principal and interest were insurable on a
pass-through basis to each mortgagee, investor, or security holder,
while funds representing payments of taxes and insurance have been
insurable on a pass-through basis to each mortgagor or borrower. This
treatment was consistent with the FDIC's longstanding view, dating from
the adoption of the rules, that principal and interest funds are owned
by the owners (or mortgagee, investor or security holder) on whose
behalf the servicer, as agent, accepts the principal and interest
payments, and are not funds owned by the borrowers. Taxes and insurance
funds, on the other hand, are insured to the mortgagors or borrowers
under the view that the latter funds are still owned by the borrower
until the servicer actually pays the tax and insurance bills.
    In October of last year, the FDIC issued an interim rule addressing
the insurance coverage of mortgage servicing accounts.\7\ In the
interim rule, the FDIC acknowledged that securitization methods for
mortgages have become increasingly complex, with multi-layer
securitization structures possible, and indicated that as a consequence
it has become both more difficult and time-consuming for a servicer to
identify and determine the share of any investor in a securitization
and in the principal and interest funds on deposit at an insured
depository institution. Prior to the issuance of the interim rule, the
FDIC had become increasingly concerned that, in the event of a failure
of an FDIC-insured depository institution, a servicer holding a deposit
account in the institution would have a difficult and time-consuming
task to identify every security holder in the securitization and
determine his or her share. Further, the FDIC believed that application
of the prior deposit insurance rule could result in delays in the
servicer receiving the insured amounts, and result in losses for
amounts that, due to the complexity of the securitization agreements,
could not be attributed to the particular investors to whom the funds
belong. Ultimately, because the FDIC concluded that application of the
previous rule could potentially result in increased losses to otherwise
insured depositors, lead to withdrawal of deposits for principal and

[[Page 47714]]

interest payments from depository institutions, and unnecessarily
reduce liquidity for such institutions, the FDIC issued the interim
rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 73 FR 61658 (Oct. 17, 2008).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In issuing the interim rule, the FDIC sought to make the deposit
insurance coverage rules for mortgage servicing accounts easy to
understand and apply. Moreover, because the considerable sum of
principal and interest funds on deposit at insured depository
institutions serve as a significant source of liquidity for the
institutions and a source of credit to the institutions' respective
communities, the FDIC sought to prevent the application of the
insurance rules from prompting any inadvertent, adverse consequences.
To address these aims, as well as the practical issues presented by
increasingly complex securitization methods, the interim rule
determined deposit insurance coverage on principal and interest
payments in a mortgage servicing account on a per-mortgagor (or per-
borrower) basis--and not on a pass-through basis to each mortgagee,
investor, or security holder--due to the fact that servicers are able
to identify mortgagors more quickly than investors. This approach
enables the FDIC to pay deposit insurance more quickly. Specifically,
the interim rule provided deposit insurance coverage to a mortgage
servicing account based on each mortgagor's payments of principal and
interest into the account up to the standard maximum deposit insurance
amount of $250,000 per mortgagor.
    Coverage is thus provided to the mortgagees/investors as a
collective group, based on the cumulative amount of the mortgagors'
payments of principal and interest into the account. This deposit
insurance coverage of payments of principal and interest per mortgagor
is not aggregated with, nor otherwise affects, the coverage provided to
each such mortgagor in other accounts the mortgagor might maintain at
the same depository institution. This is to be distinguished from the
deposit insurance coverage afforded to payments of taxes and insurance
premiums. Consistent with their treatment historically under the
deposit insurance rules, amounts in a mortgage servicing account that
represent payments for taxes and insurance are insured on a pass-
through basis as the funds of each respective mortgagor, but unlike a
mortgagor's principal and interest payments in the mortgage servicing
account, the payments for taxes and insurance are added to other
individually owned funds of each mortgagor at the same institution and
insured up to the applicable limit.

Comments on the Interim Rule's Mortgage Servicing Provisions

    The FDIC received five comments on the interim rule addressing the
deposit insurance coverage of mortgage servicing accounts. All five
comments favored the interim rule's handling of deposit insurance
coverage on payments of principal and interest in a mortgage servicing
account on a per-mortgagor (or per-borrower) basis. These views
included comments from a large bank trade association, a loan servicer,
a large government sponsored enterprise, a loan securitization
professional, along with one comment submitted by a national bank.
Although all five commenters supported the FDIC's interim rule, several
raised specific issues.
    One commenter advocated that the regulations clarify that payments
of taxes and insurance in mortgage servicing accounts and ``any similar
accounts'' held by a servicer or paying agent should not be aggregated
with personal accounts of a mortgagor, and noted that the interim rule
was ``not clear'' in this regard. Two commenters urged the FDIC to
apply the interim rule's treatment of principal and interest payments
comprising mortgage servicing accounts to other types of servicing
accounts that similarly consist of principal and interest payments but
for non-mortgage loans, such as motor vehicle loans. In short, they
suggested that the FDIC extend the interim rule's treatment of
principal and interest cash flows to other types of loan
securitizations and not simply mortgages, and suggested that these sums
may raise liquidity concerns similar to those raised by mortgage loan
servicing account funds.
    Another commenter supported the interim rule but expressed concern
that several types of mortgage servicing deposits might not be
adequately insured. For example, this commenter advocated that the
rules provide pass-through deposit insurance coverage, on a per-
borrower basis, to other types of mortgage servicing funds, such as
``repair escrows, replacement reserve escrows, bond related escrow
accounts, rental achievement escrows, and debt service escrows.'' This
commenter urged the FDIC to separately insure such accounts, as well as
escrows for taxes and insurance, up to the SMDIA.

The Final Rule on Mortgage Servicing Accounts

    The final rule is essentially unchanged from the interim rule.
Although one commenter urged that the FDIC clarify in the rules that
payments of taxes and insurance in mortgage servicing accounts and any
``similar'' accounts held by a servicer should not be aggregated with
personal accounts of a mortgagor, and asserted that the interim rule
was ``not clear'' in this regard, the FDIC concludes that any
additional clarification is unneeded. The interim rule expressly
addressed this issue with respect to tax and insurance payments in
servicing accounts, and specifically contrasted the deposit insurance
treatment of payments of taxes and insurance with the insurance
treatment afforded payments of principal and interest in servicing
accounts. The interim rule provided that the FDIC's historical
treatment of taxes and insurance payments had not changed. Drawing a
clear distinction with principal and interest payments, the interim
rule provided that taxes and insurance funds are instead ``insured to
the mortgagors or borrowers on the theory that the borrower still owns
the funds until the tax and insurance bills are actually paid by the
servicer.''
    The preamble to the interim rule indicated that, although the
principal and interest payments in mortgage servicing accounts are not
aggregated for insurance purposes with other accounts the mortgagor
might maintain at the same insured depository institution, ``[a]s under
the current insurance rules, under the interim rule amounts in a
mortgage servicing account constituting payments of taxes and insurance
premiums will be insured on a pass-through basis as the funds of each
respective mortgagor,'' and such funds ``will be added to other
individually owned funds held by each such mortgagor at the same
insured institution.'' This was also made clear in the FDIC's Financial
Institution Letter, FIL-111-2008, issued October 8, 2008. In short, the
interim rule did not alter the FDIC's historical treatment of payments
by mortgagors of tax and insurance premiums in mortgage servicing
accounts.
    It was also suggested that the FDIC extend the interim rule's
deposit insurance treatment of principal and interest cash flows to
servicing accounts for other types of loan securitizations--and not
simply mortgages--such as motor vehicle loans. The FDIC declines to do
so. As noted in the interim rule, the FDIC sought to address the
increasing complexity of mortgage securitizations and the resulting
impact these complexities have upon depositor certainty as to the
application of deposit insurance rules, and have upon the timely
resolution of deposit insurance determinations.

[[Page 47715]]

    The FDIC also declines the commenter suggestion that separate
insurance, on a pass-through, per-borrower basis be afforded to other
types of mortgage servicing funds such as ``repair escrows, replacement
reserve escrows, bond related escrow accounts, rental achievement
escrows, and debt service escrows.'' As the FDIC noted in the interim
rule, consistent with its previous deposit insurance rules, amounts in
a mortgage servicing account constituting payments of taxes and
insurance premiums are insured on a pass-through basis as the funds of
each respective mortgagor and are added to other individually owned
funds held by each such mortgagor at the same insured institution. The
FDIC's interim rule sought to make the deposit insurance coverage rules
for mortgage servicing accounts easy to understand and apply.
Additionally, because principal and interest funds on deposit at
insured depository institutions serve as both a significant source of
liquidity for the institutions and a significant source of credit to
the institution's community, the FDIC sought to ensure that no
inadvertent adverse consequences resulted from the application of the
deposit insurance rules. It is not clear that the suggested revisions
would be consistent with either of these aims. Although commenter[s]
suggested that other types of ``escrow'' funds should garner similar
treatment under the insurance rules as do deposits representing tax and
insurance payments, the comment does not clearly identify in what
specific manner the legal rights and obligations attendant to these
various types of bond-related, debt service, and rental achievement
escrows are similar to the rights and obligations of mortgagors in
their tax and insurance payments. Nor is it clear whether, and to what
extent, such payments represent a significant liquidity source for
depository institutions such that the need for more specific clarity as
to deposit insurance is needed in order to avert any inadvertent
consequences or losses to borrowers or investors.

IV. Technical Amendments to FDIC International Banking Regulations

    The FDIC is also amending its Part 347 International Banking
regulations to make technical, conforming amendments relating to the
SMDIA. The FDI Reform Act introduced the term ``SMDIA'' and instituted
several substantive changes to the deposit insurance coverage
provisions in the FDI Act. Additionally, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005 (``Reform Conforming Act''),
Public Law 109-173, amended the International Banking Act of 1978, 12
U.S.C. 3104, necessitating the need for technical conforming amendments
to substitute the term ``SMDIA'' in place of ``$100,000'' in the FDIC's
International Banking regulations. 12 CFR Part 347.\8\ The four-year
extension in the increase in the SMDIA, which provides the FDIC with
the necessity to make revisions to the deposit insurance regulations
and examples therein, also affords the FDIC with the opportunity to now
make technical amendments to the FDIC's international banking
regulations to replace several distinct references to a ``$100,000''
benchmark with references to the SMDIA, consistent with the Reform
Conforming Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Per statute, the Reform Conforming Act substitution of the
SMDIA in the international banking provisions was effective on April
1, 2006. Reform Conforming Act Sec.  2; 71 FR 14629 (March 23,
2006).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

V. Paperwork Reduction Act

    The final rule will revise the FDIC's deposit insurance
regulations. It will not involve any new collections of information
pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).
Consequently, no information collection has been submitted to the
Office of Management and Budget for review.

VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires an agency that is issuing a
final rule to prepare and make available a regulatory flexibility
analysis that describes the impact of the final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603(a). The Regulatory Flexibility Act provides that an agency
is not required to prepare and publish a regulatory flexibility
analysis if the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
    Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the
FDIC certifies that the final rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The final rule implements
the temporary increase in the SMDIA, simplifies the coverage rules for
mortgage servicing accounts, and simplifies the deposit insurance rules
for revocable trust accounts held at FDIC-insured depository
institutions.

VII. The Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999--
Assessment of Federal Regulations and Policies on Families

    The FDIC has determined that the final rule will not affect family
well-being within the meaning of section 654 of the Treasury and
General Government Appropriations Act, enacted as part of the Omnibus
Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999
(Pub. L. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681). The final rule should have a
positive effect on families by clarifying the coverage rules for
mortgage servicing accounts, which contain, for a period of time, the
mortgage payments from borrowers, and the rules for revocable trust
accounts, a popular type of consumer bank account.

VIII. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act

    The Office of Management and Budget has determined that the final
rule is not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of the relevant
sections of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act of 1996
(``SBREFA'') (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.). As required by SBREFA, the FDIC
will file the appropriate reports with Congress and the General
Accounting Office so that the final rule may be reviewed.

IX. Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Blilely Act (Pub. L. 106-102, 113
Stat. 1338, 1471), requires the Federal banking agencies to use plain
language in all proposed and final rules published after January 1,
2000. The FDIC has sought to present the final rule in a simple and
straightforward manner, and has made revisions to the previous interim
rule in response to commenter concerns seeking clarification of the
application of the deposit insurance rules.

For the reasons stated above, the Board of Directors of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation hereby amends parts 330 and 347 of title
12 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:

PART 330--DEPOSIT INSURANCE COVERAGE

1. The authority citation for part 330 continues to read as follows:

    Authority: 12 U.S.C. 1813(1), 1813(m), 1817(i), 1818(q), 1819
(Tenth), 1820(f), 1821(a), 1822(c).

2. In Sec.  330.1, paragraph (n) is revised to read as follows:


Sec.  330.1  Definitions.

* * * * *
    (n) Standard maximum deposit insurance amount, referred to as the
``SMDIA'' hereafter, means $250,000 from October 3, 2008, until
December 31, 2013. Effective January 1, 2014, the SMDIA means $100,000
adjusted pursuant to subparagraph (F) of section 11(a)(1) of the FDI
Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(a)(1)(F)). All examples in this part use $250,000
as the SMDIA.

3. In Sec.  330.7, paragraph (d) is revised to read as follows:


Sec.  330.7  Account held by an agent, nominee, guardian, custodian or
conservator.

* * * * *
    (d) Mortgage servicing accounts. Accounts maintained by a mortgage
servicer, in a custodial or other fiduciary capacity, which are
comprised of payments by mortgagors of principal and interest, shall be
insured for the cumulative balance paid into the account by the
mortgagors, up to the limit of the SMDIA per mortgagor. Accounts
maintained by a mortgage servicer, in a custodial or other fiduciary
capacity, which are comprised of payments by mortgagors of taxes and
insurance premiums shall be added together and insured in accordance
with paragraph (a) of this section for the ownership interest of each
mortgagor in such accounts. This provision is effective as of October
10, 2008, for all existing and future mortgage servicing accounts.
* * * * *

4. In Sec.  330.9, paragraph (b) is revised to read as follows:


Sec.  330.9  Joint ownership accounts.

* * * * *
    (b) Determination of insurance coverage. The interests of each co-
owner in all qualifying joint accounts shall be added together and the
total shall be insured up to the SMDIA. (Example: ``A&B'' have a
qualifying joint account with a balance of $150,000; ``A&C'' have a
qualifying joint account with a balance of $200,000; and ``A&B&C'' have
a qualifying joint account with a balance of $375,000. A's combined
ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $300,000
($75,000 plus $100,000 plus $125,000); therefore, A's interest would be
insured in the amount of $250,000 and uninsured in the amount of
$50,000. B's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint
accounts would be $200,000 ($75,000 plus $125,000); therefore, B's
interest would be fully insured. C's combined ownership interest in all
qualifying joint accounts would be $225,000 ($100,000 plus $125,000);
therefore, C's interest would be fully insured.
* * * * *

0
5. Section 330.10 is revised to read as follows:


Sec.  330.10  Revocable trust accounts.

    (a) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this
section, the funds owned by an individual and deposited into one or
more accounts with respect to which the owner evidences an intention
that upon his or her death the funds shall belong to one or more
beneficiaries shall be separately insured (from other types of accounts
the owner has at the same insured depository institution) in an amount
equal to the total number of different beneficiaries named in the
account(s) multiplied by the SMDIA. This section applies to all
accounts held in connection with informal and formal testamentary
revocable trusts. Such informal trusts are commonly referred to as
payable-on-death accounts, in-trust-for accounts or Totten Trust
accounts, and such formal trusts are commonly referred to as living
trusts or family trusts. (Example 1: Account Owner ``A'' has a living
trust account with four different beneficiaries named in the trust. A
has no other revocable trust accounts at the same FDIC-insured
institution. The maximum insurance coverage would be $1,000,000,
determined by multiplying 4 times $250,000 (the number of beneficiaries
times the SMDIA). (Example 2: Account Owner ``A'' has a payable-on-
death account naming his niece and cousin as beneficiaries, and A also
has, at the same FDIC-insured institution, another payable-on-death
account naming the same niece and a friend as beneficiaries. The
maximum coverage available to the account owner would be $750,000. This
is because the account owner has named only three different
beneficiaries in the revocable trust accounts--his niece and cousin in
the first, and the same niece and a friend in the second. The naming of
the same beneficiary in more than one revocable trust account, whether
it be a payable-on-death account or living trust account, does not
increase the total coverage amount.) (Example 3: Account Owner ``A''
establishes a living trust account, with a balance of $300,000, naming
his two children ``B'' and ``C'' as beneficiaries. A also establishes,
at the same FDIC-insured institution, a payable-on-death account, with
a balance of $300,000, also naming his children B and C as
beneficiaries. The maximum coverage available to A is $500,000,
determined by multiplying 2 times $250,000 (the number of different
beneficiaries times the SMDIA). A is uninsured in the amount of
$100,000. This is because all funds that a depositor holds in both
living trust accounts and payable-on-death accounts, at the same FDIC-
insured institution and naming the same beneficiaries, are aggregated
for insurance purposes and insured to the applicable coverage limits.)
    (b) Required intention and naming of beneficiaries. (1) The
required intention in paragraph (a) of this section that upon the
owner's death the funds shall belong to one or more beneficiaries must
be manifested in the ``title'' of the account using commonly accepted
terms such as, but not limited to, ``in trust for,'' ``as trustee
for,'' ``payable-on-death to,'' or any acronym therefor. For purposes
of this requirement, ``title'' includes the electronic deposit account
records of the institution. (For example, the FDIC would recognize an
account as a revocable trust account even if the title of the account
signature card does not designate the account as a revocable trust
account as long as the institution's electronic deposit account records
identify (through a code or otherwise) the account as a revocable trust
account.) The settlor of a revocable trust shall be presumed to own the
funds deposited into the account.
    (2) For informal revocable trust accounts, the beneficiaries must
be specifically named in the deposit account records of the insured
depository institution.
    (c) Definition of beneficiary. For purposes of this section, a
beneficiary includes a natural person as well as a charitable
organization and other non-profit entity recognized as such under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
    (d) Interests of beneficiaries outside the definition of
beneficiary in this section. If a beneficiary named in a trust covered
by this section does not meet the definition of beneficiary in
paragraph (c) of this section, the funds corresponding to that
beneficiary shall be treated as the individually owned (single
ownership) funds of the owner(s). As such, they shall be aggregated
with any other single ownership accounts of such owner(s) and insured
up to the SMDIA per owner. (Example: Account Owner ``A'' establishes a
payable-on-death account naming a pet as beneficiary with a balance of
$100,000. A also has an individual account at the same FDIC-insured
institution with a balance of

[[Page 47717]]

$175,000. Because the pet is not a ``beneficiary,'' the two accounts
are aggregated and treated as a single ownership account. As a result,
A is insured in the amount of $250,000, but is uninsured for the
remaining $25,000.)
    (e) Revocable trust accounts with aggregate balances exceeding five
times the SMDIA and naming more than five different beneficiaries.
Notwithstanding the general coverage provisions in paragraph (a) of
this section, for funds owned by an individual in one or more revocable
trust accounts naming more than five different beneficiaries and whose
aggregate balance is more than five times the SMDIA, the maximum
revocable trust account coverage for the account owner shall be the
greater of either: five times the SMDIA or the aggregate amount of the
interests of each different beneficiary named in the trusts, to a limit
of the SMDIA per different beneficiary. (Example 1: Account Owner ``A''
has a living trust with a balance of $1 million and names two friends,
``B'' and ``C'' as beneficiaries. At the same FDIC-insured institution,
A establishes a payable-on-death account, with a balance of $1 million
naming his two cousins, ``D'' and ``E'' as beneficiaries. Coverage is
determined under the general coverage provisions in paragraph (a) of
this section, and not this paragraph (e). This is because all funds
that A holds in both living trust accounts and payable-on-death
accounts, at the same FDIC-insured institution, are aggregated for
insurance purposes. Although A's aggregated balance of $2 million is
more than five times the SMDIA, A names only four different
beneficiaries, and coverage under this paragraph (e) applies only if
there are more than five different beneficiaries. A is insured in the
amount of $1 million (4 beneficiaries times the SMDIA), and uninsured
for the remaining $1 million.) (Example 2: Account Owner ``A'' has a
living trust account with a balance of $1,500,000. Under the terms of
the trust, upon A's death, A's three children are each entitled to
$125,000, A's friend is entitled to $15,000, and a designated charity
is entitled to $175,000. The trust also provides that the remainder of
the trust assets shall belong to A's spouse. In this case, because the
balance of the account exceeds $1,250,000 (5 times the SMDIA) and there
are more than five different beneficiaries named in the trust, the
maximum coverage available to A would be the greater of: $1,250,000 or
the aggregate of each different beneficiary's interest to a limit of
$250,000 per beneficiary. The beneficial interests in the trust for
purposes of determining coverage are: $125,000 for each of the children
(totaling $375,000), $15,000 for the friend, $175,000 for the charity,
and $250,000 for the spouse (because the spouse's $935,000 is subject
to the $250,000 per-beneficiary limitation). The aggregate beneficial
interests total $815,000. Thus, the maximum coverage afforded to the
account owner would be $1,250,000, the greater of $1,250,000 or
$815,000.)
    (f) Co-owned revocable trust accounts. (1) Where an account
described in paragraph (a) of this section is established by more than
one owner, the respective interest of each account owner (which shall
be deemed equal) shall be insured separately, per different
beneficiary, up to the SMDIA, subject to the limitation imposed in
paragraph (e) of this section. (Example 1: A and B, two individuals,
establish a payable-on-death account naming their three nieces as
beneficiaries. Neither A nor B has any other revocable trust accounts
at the same FDIC-insured institution. The maximum coverage afforded to
A and B would be $1,500,000, determined by multiplying the number of
owners (2) times the SMDIA ($250,000) times the number of different
beneficiaries (3). In this example, A would be entitled to revocable
trust coverage of $750,000 and B would be entitled to revocable trust
coverage of $750,000.) (Example 2: A and B, two individuals, establish
a payable-on-death account naming their two children, two cousins, and
a charity as beneficiaries. The balance in the account is $1,750,000.
Neither A nor B has any other revocable trust accounts at the same
FDIC-insured institution. The maximum coverage would be determined
(under paragraph (a) of this section) by multiplying the number of
account owners (2) times the number of different beneficiaries (5)
times $250,000, totaling $2,500,000. Because the account balance
($1,750,000) is less than the maximum coverage amount ($2,500,000), the
account would be fully insured.) (Example 3: A and B, two individuals,
establish a living trust account with a balance of $3.75 million. Under
the terms of the trust, upon the death of both A and B, each of their
three children is entitled to $600,000, B's cousin is entitled to
$380,000, A's friend is entitled to $70,000, and the remaining amount
($1,500,000) goes to a charity. Under paragraph (e) of this section,
the maximum coverage, as to each co-owned account owner, would be the
greater of $1,250,000 or the aggregate amount (as to each co-owner) of
the interest of each different beneficiary named in the trust, to a
limit of $250,000 per account owner per beneficiary. The beneficial
interests in the trust considered for purposes of determining coverage
for account owner A are: $750,000 for the children (each child's
interest attributable to A, $300,000, is subject to the $250,000-per-
beneficiary limitation), $190,000 for the cousin, $35,000 for the
friend, and $250,000 for the charity (the charity's interest
attributable to A, $750,000, is subject to the $250,000 per-beneficiary
limitation). As to A, the aggregate amount of the beneficial interests
eligible for deposit insurance coverage totals $1,225,000. Thus, the
maximum coverage afforded to account co-owner A would be $1,250,000,
which is the greater of $1,250,000 or the aggregate of all the
beneficial interests attributable to A (limited to $250,000 per
beneficiary), which totaled slightly less at $1,225,000. Because B has
equal ownership interest in the trust, the same analysis and coverage
determination also would apply to B. Thus, of the total account balance
of $3.75 million, $2.5 million would be insured and $1.25 million would
be uninsured.)
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1) of this section, where the
owners of a co-owned revocable trust account are themselves the sole
beneficiaries of the corresponding trust, the account shall be insured
as a joint account under Sec.  330.9 and shall not be insured under the
provisions of this section. (Example: If A and B establish a payable-
on-death account naming themselves as the sole beneficiaries of the
account, the account will be insured as a joint account because the
account does not satisfy the intent requirement (under paragraph (a) of
this section) that the funds in the account belong to the named
beneficiaries upon the owners' death. The beneficiaries are in fact the
actual owners of the funds during the account owners' lifetimes.)
    (g) For deposit accounts held in connection with a living trust
that provides for a life-estate interest for designated beneficiaries,
the FDIC shall value each such life estate interest as the SMDIA for
purposes of determining the insurance coverage available to the account
owner under paragraph (e) of this section. (Example: Account Owner
``A'' has a living trust account with a balance of $1,500,000. Under
the terms of the trust, A provides a life estate interest for his
spouse. Moreover, A's three children are each entitled to $275,000, A's
friend is entitled to $15,000, and a designated charity is entitled to
$175,000. The trust also provides that the remainder of the trust
assets shall belong to A's granddaughter. In this case, because the
balance of the account exceeds $1,250,000 ((5) five

[[Page 47718]]

times the SMDIA) and there are more than five different beneficiaries
named in the trust, the maximum coverage available to A would be the
greater of: $1,250,000 or the aggregate of each different beneficiary's
interest to a limit of $250,000 per beneficiary. The beneficial
interests in the trust considered for purposes of determining coverage
are: $250,000 for the spouse's life estate, $750,000 for the children
(because each child's $275,000 is subject to the $250,000 per-
beneficiary limitation), $15,000 for the friend, $175,000 for the
charity, and $250,000 for the granddaughter (because the
granddaughter's $310,000 remainder is limited by the $250,000 per-
beneficiary limitation). The aggregate beneficial interests total
$1,440,000. Thus, the maximum coverage afforded to the account owner
would be $1,440,000, the greater of $1,250,000 or $1,440,000.)
    (h) Revocable trusts that become irrevocable trusts.
Notwithstanding the provisions in section 330.13 on the insurance
coverage of irrevocable trust accounts, if a revocable trust account
converts in part or entirely to an irrevocable trust upon the death of
one or more of the trust's owners, the trust account shall continue to
be insured under the provisions of this section. (Example: Assume A and
B have a trust account in connection with a living trust, of which they
are joint grantors. If upon the death of either A or B the trust
transforms into an irrevocable trust as to the deceased grantor's
ownership in the trust, the account will continue to be insured under
the provisions of this section.)
    (i) This section shall apply to all existing and future revocable
trust accounts and all existing and future irrevocable trust accounts
resulting from formal revocable trust accounts.

Sec.  347.215  Exemptions from deposit insurance requirement.

    (a) Deposit activities not requiring insurance. A State branch will
not be considered to be engaged in domestic retail deposit activity
that requires the foreign bank parent to establish an insured U.S. bank
subsidiary if the State branch accepts initial deposits only in an
amount of less than an amount equal to the SMDIA that are derived
solely from the following:
* * * * *
    (b) Application for an exemption. (1) Whenever a foreign bank
proposes to accept at a State branch initial deposits of less than an
amount equal to the SMDIA and such deposits are not otherwise exempted
under paragraph (a) of this section, the foreign bank may apply to the
FDIC for consent to operate the branch as a noninsured branch. The
Board of Directors may exempt the branch from the insurance requirement
if the branch is not engaged in domestic retail deposit activities
requiring insurance protection. The Board of Directors will consider
the size and nature of depositors and deposit accounts, the importance
of maintaining and improving the availability of credit to all sectors
of the United States economy, including the international trade finance
sector of the United States economy, whether the exemption would give
the foreign bank an unfair competitive advantage over United States
banking organizations, and any other relevant factors in making this
determination.
