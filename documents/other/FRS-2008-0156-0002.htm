FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

12 CFR Part 261a

[Docket No. R-1313]

 
Privacy Act of 1974; Privacy Act Regulation

AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) 
is issuing a final rule to amend its regulation implementing the 
Privacy Act of 1974 (Privacy Act). The primary changes concern the 
waiver of copying fees charged to current and former Board employees, 
and applicants for Board employment, for access to their records under 
the Privacy Act; the amendment of special procedures for the release of 
medical records to permit the Board's Chief Privacy Officer to consult 
with the Board's Employee Assistance Program counselor to determine 
whether the disclosure of medical records directly to the requester 
could have an adverse effect on the requester; changes to the time 
limits for responding to requests for access to information and 
amendment of records; and updates to the exemptions claimed for certain 
systems of records. In addition, the Board is proposing to make minor 
editorial and technical changes to ensure that the Board's regulation 
is consistent with the Board's published systems of records and is 
clearer.

DATES: This rule is effective October 18, 2010.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brad Fleetwood, Senior Counsel, (202) 
452-3721, Legal Division. For users of Telecommunications Device for 
the Deaf (TDD) only, contact (202) 263-4869.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Board published a notice of proposed 
rulemaking to amend its regulation implementing the Privacy Act in the 
Federal Register, 73 FR 25594, May 7, 2008. The proposed amendments: 
(1) Waived all copying fees in connection with any Privacy Act request 
by current or former Board employees and applicants for Board 
employment; (2) permitted the Chief Privacy Officer to consult with the 
Board's Employee Assistance Program counselor as well as the Board's 
physician to determine whether the disclosure of medical records 
directly to the requester could have an adverse effect on the 
requester; (3) required all requests for access (including requests 
made by current Board employees for access to their personnel records) 
to be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Board; (4) 
lengthened the time limits for acknowledging (and where practicable, 
substantially responding to) an individual's request for access to 
information and making a determination on a request to amend an 
individual's record; (5) replaced the statutory exemptions listed in 
the Privacy Act with references to the relevant provisions in the 
Privacy Act; (6) updated the exemptions listed under 12 CFR 261a.12 to 
conform to the exemptions approved for each of the Board's Privacy Act 
systems of records; and (7) made minor editorial and technical changes 
for clarity and consistency with the Board's published systems of 
records.
    In response to these proposed amendments, the Board received three 
public comments relating to the privacy of information held by banks 
and other financial institutions. Because the Board's Privacy Act 
regulation does not regulate the privacy of this information, the Board 
did not consider these comments relevant.
    The Board's final rule adopts all of the amendments as proposed 
except that the Board has determined to revise the requirement that all 
requests for access be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the 
Board. This amendment was proposed to facilitate appropriate tracking 
and processing of all Privacy Act requests. However, after an internal 
review of this matter, the Board determined that because current and 
former employees frequently request access to records about themselves 
directly from Human Resources (HR) in person to require such employees 
to instead seek this information from the Secretary's Office in writing 
would be extremely burdensome. Any benefit from an increased ability to 
track these requests would be more than outweighed by the increased 
difficulty that employees would face in seeking information about 
themselves.

[[Page 63704]]

Therefore, the Board has determined that it is unnecessary at this time 
to require current or former employees to make Privacy Act requests 
through the Secretary's Office. The final rule permits current and 
former Board employees to make Privacy Act requests in person or in 
writing to the Board office that maintains the record. The Board 
believes that this will facilitate employees' access to their records 
consistent with the requirements of the Privacy Act. If the Secretary 
determines that this option impedes or frustrates in any way the 
appropriate tracking of requests, the Secretary may notify requesters 
that they must submit their requests through the Secretary's office. In 
any case, a denial of an employee's request (in whole or in part) must 
be reported to the Secretary of the Board so that the Secretary can 
ensure that the request was appropriately processed.
    The Board's final rule also updates section 261a.5(c) regarding 
verification of identity to make it clear that a Board identification 
card is considered valid proof of identity for current and former Board 
employees. In addition, during the time between the date the proposed 
rulemaking was published and this final rulemaking, the Board published 
two new systems of records, BGFRS-37 (Electronic Applications) and 
BGFRS-38 (Transportation Subsidy Records). As noted in the related 
Federal Register Notice, 73 FR 54595, September 22, 2008, certain 
portions of BGFRS-37 (Electronic Applications) may be exempt from 5 
U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f) of the 
Privacy Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). Thus, the Board has 
amended section 261a.12 to reflect this exemption.

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

    The Privacy Act Regulation sets forth the procedures by which 
individuals may request access and amendment to records maintained in 
systems of records at the Board. The Board certifies that this rule 
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities, because it does not apply to business entities.
