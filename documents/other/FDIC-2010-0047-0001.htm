RIN 3064-AD59


Special Reporting, Analysis and Contingent Resolution Plans at
Certain Large Insured Depository Institutions

AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'').

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FDIC is seeking comment on a proposed rule that would
require certain identified insured depository institutions (``IDIs'')
that are subsidiaries of large and complex financial parent companies
to submit to the FDIC analysis, information, and contingent resolution
plans that address and demonstrate the IDI's ability to be separated
from its parent structure, and to be wound down or resolved in an
orderly fashion. The IDI's plan would include a gap analysis that would
identify impediments to the orderly stand-alone resolution of the IDI,
and identify reasonable steps that are or will be taken to eliminate or
mitigate such impediments. The contingent resolution plan, gap
analysis, and mitigation efforts are intended to enable the FDIC to
develop a reasonable strategy, plan or options for the orderly
resolution of the institution. The proposal would apply only to IDIs
with greater than $10 billion in total assets that are owned or
controlled by parent companies with more than $100 billion in total
assets.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Special Reporting, Analysis and Contingent Resolution Plans at
Certain Large Insured Depository Institutions

(A) Authority for Proposed Regulation

    The FDIC is charged by Congress with the critical responsibility of
insuring the deposits of banks and thrifts in the United States, and
with serving as receiver of all such institutions if they should fail.
As of December 31, 2009, the FDIC insured approximately $4.75 trillion
in deposits in more than 8,000 depository institutions. In implementing
the deposit insurance program, and in efficiently and effectively
resolving failed depository institutions, the FDIC strengthens the
stability of the banking system and helps maintain public confidence in
the banking industry in the United States. In its efforts to achieve
this objective and to implement its insurance and resolution functions,
the FDIC requires a comprehensive understanding of the organization,
operation and business practices of banks and thrifts in the United
States, with particular attention to the nation's largest and most
complex insured depository institutions that account for nearly half of
the FDIC's insurance risk.
    To carry out these core responsibilities, the proposed regulation
requires a limited number of the largest insured depository
institutions to provide the FDIC with essential information concerning
their structure, operations, business practices and financial
responsibilities and exposures. The proposed regulation requires these
institutions to develop and submit detailed plans demonstrating how
such depository institutions could be separated from their affiliate
structure and wound down in an orderly and timely manner in the event
of receivership. The proposed regulation would also make a critically
important contribution to the FDIC's implementation of its statutory
receivership responsibilities by providing the FDIC as receiver with
the information it needs to make orderly and cost effective resolutions
much more feasible.
    The Federal Deposit Insurance Act gives the FDIC broad authority to
carry out its statutory responsibilities, and to obtain the information
required by the proposed regulation. The authority to issue the
proposed regulation is provided by Section 9(a) Tenth of the FDI Act,
12 U.S.C. section 1819(a) Tenth, authorizing the FDIC to prescribe, by
its Board of Directors, such rules and regulations as it may deem
necessary to carry out the provisions of the FDI Act or of any other
law that the FDIC is responsible for administering or enforcing. The
FDIC also has authority to adopt regulations governing the operations
of its receiverships pursuant to Section 11(d)(1) of the FDI Act. 12
U.S.C. section 1821(d)(1). Collection of the information required by
the regulation is also supported by the FDIC's broad authority to
conduct examinations of depository institutions to determine the
condition of the IDI, including special examinations, 12 U.S.C. section
1820(b)(3).

[[Page 27465]]

    Finally, a failure of an IDI to provide the information required by
this regulation would constitute a regulatory violation that would
allow the FDIC to initiate the process of deposit insurance termination
(12 U.S.C. section 1818(a)(2)), or to use backup enforcement authority
of the FDIC under 12 U.S.C. section 1818(t). This backup enforcement
authority allows the FDIC, after notice to the primary Federal
regulator, to pursue FDI Act section 8 enforcement actions, including
cease-and-desist orders, civil money penalties, and removal and
prohibition actions.

(B) Background

    Over the past decades, the size and complexity of insured
depository institutions (``IDIs'') have evolved dramatically. More
recently, and as a result of the financial crisis, the industry has
seen further consolidation and continued expansion in the scope of
insured depository institutions' activities, operations, and risks. As
a result of continued consolidation of the U.S. banking industry, the
FDIC's insurance risk is now concentrated in the largest and most
complex insured depository institutions. Today, almost half of the
FDIC's deposit insurance exposure is accounted for by fewer than 40
large institutions that exist within even larger conglomerate and
multinational structures.
    These large and complex IDIs present profound challenges to the
FDIC both as insurer and when it must act in its receivership capacity.
The complexity of these IDIs, the extensive financial
interrelationships within the conglomerates, and the likely presence of
competing statutory regimes that may apply to the IDI, its parent
corporation and key affiliates, result in opaque structures that
prevent the FDIC from gaining access to information that is essential
to the FDIC's assessment of its risks as insurer and to its ability to
resolve the IDI in a cost-effective and timely fashion as receiver, in
the event of failure. Also, given the extensive interconnectedness of
the IDI with its parent and affiliates, the FDIC can be significantly
hindered in its mission to effect an orderly and timely resolution,
minimize cost to the insurance fund, and to maximize recoveries to
depositors and other claimants. This mission is separate and distinct
from the mission of the primary Federal supervisor. Complementing the
supervisory oversight of the primary Federal regulator, the FDIC's role
as insurer and resolver requires a distinct focus on loss severities,
default risks, complexities in structure and operations, and other
factors that impact risk to the fund and the ability of the FDIC to
effect an orderly resolution.
    The proposed rule is intended to ensure that the FDIC has access to
all the information it needs to assess its insurance risk in connection
with large IDIs existing within such structures, and to efficiently
resolve such IDIs in the event of failure. The rule requires identified
IDIs to compile information, conduct analyses and develop plans that
will enable the FDIC to understand and anticipate the operational,
managerial, financial and other aspects of the IDI that would
complicate efforts by the FDIC, as receiver, to extract the IDI from
the larger enterprise, determine and maximize franchise value, and
conduct a least-cost transaction.
    Organizational and operational complexity of the largest IDIs
results in opaque structures. The very largest IDIs reside within bank,
thrift and financial holding company structures that include an
extensive network of affiliated companies offering both banking and
non-banking products and services. Management and operation of these
complex entities is typically organized along business lines rather
than by legal entity. Key decisions affecting the IDI, and key services
or functions relating to the IDI, are often made outside the IDI, by
parent holding companies or affiliates of the IDI. Complex financial
and other interrelationships within such groups (for example,
guaranties, derivatives trades, contractual commitments, service
agreements, information technology agreements, staffing allocations,
human resource and related administrative support ties) create further
interdependencies that can significantly impact resolution strategy and
the conduct of an orderly and timely resolution. IDIs often rely upon
affiliates for the provision of critical operations and services
without which the IDI cannot continue to smoothly function, which in a
resolution context threatens its franchise value and the FDIC's ability
to conduct an effective resolution.
    Further complications result from the presence of distinct
statutory insolvency regimes specific to the various legal entities
within the conglomerate, which often have different, and sometimes
competing, goals. Insured banks and thrifts are subject to the FDI Act
and are resolved by the FDIC. The insolvency of bank, thrift and
financial holding companies and most of their non-insured financial
subsidiaries are subject to the Bankruptcy Code.\1\ These competing
regimes result in disputes over assets, intra-affiliate claims and
litigation, and can increase the cost of the resolution and impair its
efficiency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The recent financial crisis, for example, saw the collapse
of several major financial services holding companies whose primary
business activities were not housed in an insured depository
institution. These institutions included Bear Stearns, Lehman
Brothers and American International Group (AIG). Each of these
financial holding companies was subject to the jurisdiction of the
bankruptcy courts. Broker-dealer subsidiaries of parent holding
companies that are members of the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (SIPC) are subject to a combination of the Securities
Investor Protection Act (SIPA) and the Bankruptcy Code. Further, the
rehabilitation, restructuring or liquidation of insurance company
subsidiaries is governed by unique State insurance insolvency codes,
which differ from State to State, and often also may lead to State
judicial proceedings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FDIC has determined that there is a compelling need for better
information and planning to separately resolve the insured depository
institution as a distinct entity. For example, in certain
receiverships, staff and human resources have been provided by the
parent organization, impeding the receiver's ability to effect a smooth
and orderly transition of services to the community. Critical
information technology support services are frequently conducted
outside the insured entity, forcing the receiver to seek continuity of
such key services. The FDIC has witnessed the inability of large and
complex insured depository institutions to identify the location and
legal owner of assets, to separate liquidity needs and funding sources
of the insured entity, and even to identify a separate line management
team to conduct operations during a resolution. The FDIC, moreover, has
been routinely engaged in disputes over assets, lien claims, and
related litigation with parents and affiliates, draining receivership
resources, extending the duration of the receivership and delaying the
prompt resolution of claims.
    The proposed rule is consistent with and will assist in the
implementation of ``Resolution Plan'' legislation pending in both
houses of Congress. Pending reform legislation now in both houses of
Congress requires wind-down and resolution plans to be submitted by
identified large bank holding companies or non-bank financial
companies, pursuant to regulations to be adopted jointly by the FDIC
and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``FRB'').
This important Congressional initiative is fully consistent with the
conclusion by the FDIC, based on its experience in the current
financial crisis as receiver

[[Page 27466]]

charged with responsibility for resolving failed banks (especially
large and complex IDIs), that comprehensive wind-down plans for large
and complex IDIs are essential for their orderly and least-cost
resolution. It is for that reason that the FDIC is proposing that the
process of developing plans for such IDIs should begin promptly. This
initiation of that process by FDIC under the authority of the FDI Act
will in no way conflict with the mandate of the FDIC and the FRB under
the pending legislation to establish rules and administer a system of
resolution planning for large bank holding companies and non-bank
financial companies. Indeed, the joint planning process to be conducted
by the FDIC and the FRB involving companies that include large or
complex IDIs will be able to integrate earlier resolution planning that
will take place under the FDIC proposed contingent resolution program,
and such planning should be able to continue as a part of any proposal
adopted by Congress. The FDIC, in implementing this proposal, will make
every effort to coordinate its work with the separate joint planning
process of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve to avoid duplication of
effort.
    The proposed rule similarly supports and complements related
international initiatives. At the 2009 Pittsburgh Summit, and in
response to the recent financial crisis, the G20 Leaders called on the
Financial Stability Board (FSB) to propose by the end of October 2010,
possible measures to address the ``too big to fail'' and moral hazard
concerns associated with systemically important financial institutions.
Specifically, the G20 Leaders called for the development of
``internationally-consistent firm-specific contingency and resolution
plans'' by the end of 2010. The FSB is pursuing further work to develop
the international standards for contingency and resolution plans and to
evaluate how to improve the capacity of national authorities to
implement orderly resolutions of large and interconnected financial
firms.
    The FSB's program has built on work undertaken by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision's Cross-border Bank Resolution Group,
co-chaired by the FDIC, since 2007. In its final Report and
Recommendations of the Cross-border Bank Resolution Group, issued on
March 18, 2010, the Basel Committee emphasized the importance of pre-
planning and the development of practical and credible plans to promote
resiliency in periods of severe financial distress and to facilitate a
rapid resolution should that be necessary. In its review of the
financial crisis, the Report found that one of the main lessons was
that the complexity and interconnectedness of large financial
conglomerates of corporate structure made crisis management and
resolutions more difficult and unpredictable.
    Similarly, the FSB's Principles for Cross-Border Cooperation on
Crisis Management commit national authorities to ensure that firms
develop adequate contingency plans and highlight that information needs
are paramount, including information regarding group structure, and
legal, financial and operational intra-group dependencies; the
interlinkages between the firm and financial system (e.g., in markets
and infrastructures) in each jurisdiction in which it operates; and
potential impediments to a coordinated solution stemming from the legal
frameworks and bank resolution procedures of the countries in which the
firm operates. The FSB Crisis Management Working Group has recommended
that supervisors ensure that firms are capable of supplying in a timely
fashion the information that may be required by the authorities in
managing a financial crisis. The FSB recommendations strongly encourage
firms to maintain contingency plans and procedures for use in a wind-
down situation (e.g., factsheets that could easily be used by
insolvency practitioners), and to regularly review them to ensure that
they remain accurate and adequate. This proposed rule enhances and
complements these international efforts.
    Conclusion. The FDIC believes that assessing its insurance risk and
planning for resolution of covered IDIs require access to timely,
complete and accurate information regarding the nature and structure of
the IDI within the organization as well as its ability to extract and
separate itself from its parent structure in contemplation of failure.
These information and contingency planning requirements are the
foundation for any meaningful analysis of IDI franchise value, least-
cost resolution strategies, strategies to mitigate systemic risks and
overall planning for an orderly resolution in the possible event of
failure. The recent financial crisis has demonstrated that the risk of
insolvency to an IDI can arise quickly, and that preparedness and
planning must be conducted on a continuing basis, before problems
become evident, and not merely in response to after-the-fact
supervisory indicators.
The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
    The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'') sets forth information
reporting requirements intended provide the FDIC with key information
concerning the operations, management, financial, affiliate
relationships and other aspects of IDIs operating within a complex
conglomerate to permit the FDIC to more effectively carry out its
duties as insurer and receiver. The NPR requires IDIs within the scope
of the rule to prepare, and submit to the FDIC, a contingent resolution
plan describing the means by which the IDI could be effectively
separated from the rest of the conglomerate enterprise in the event of
failure of the IDI or the bankruptcy of the parent company or any key
affiliate of the IDI. It is intended that such a plan also will assist
the FDIC, in the event of the failure of the IDI, in carrying out its
responsibilities to resolve the failed institution in timely and cost-
effective fashion. The rule proposes that the contingent resolution
plan be submitted within 6 months of the effective date of the rule.
The FDIC will review the plan in consultation with appropriate primary
Federal regulator(s) and the institution to ensure the plan is
effective, workable and satisfactory. The plan should be updated
annually, and material information elements should be updated more
frequently as reasonable and necessary, given the risk profile and
structure of the institution relative to its affiliates and to
demonstrate the capacity to provide specific information when needed
(e.g., deposit flows, intra-group funding flows, short-term funding,
derivatives transactions, or material changes to capital structure or
sources). While much more information will be required to prepare for
and implement an actual resolution, the information required under the
proposed regulation focuses on key structures, exposures, and
interlinkages necessary to evaluate and further develop the contingent
resolution plan.
    The NPR is intended to reach large, complex insured depository
institutions. Accordingly under the NPR, a ``covered insured depository
institution'' (``covered IDI'') is defined as insured depository
institutions with greater than $10 billion in total assets that are
owned or controlled by parent companies with more than $100 billion in
total assets. As of the fourth quarter of 2009, there were 40 such
institutions, representing total assets of $8.3 trillion. These 40
institutions hold approximately 47.9% of all deposits insured by the
FDIC.

[[Page 27467]]

Nature and Scope of Contingent Resolution Plan To Be Provided to the
FDIC
    The FDIC is proposing that each covered IDI develop and provide to
the FDIC a credible contingent resolution plan which sets forth
detailed information needed to allow the FDIC to understand the scope
and extent of the IDI's business lines, operations, risks and
activities, and especially to determine the nature and extent of
interrelationships between the IDI and its affiliates; to identify and
quantify non-obvious risks embedded within distinct business entities
or units; to identify concentrations of risk and correlations among
risks; and to develop an enterprise-wide and entity-specific vision of
the covered IDI.
    Some of the required information is likely already to have been
developed and/or reported elsewhere, and to the greatest extent
possible, the FDIC expects to use such existing information and reports
to minimize the regulatory burden on the covered IDIs. The FDIC
recognizes that the information and analysis provided will be
proprietary and highly confidential, and is not intended for
disclosure.
    In addition to providing information, the contingent resolution
plan should provide an analysis of the covered IDI's ability to be
resolved in an orderly fashion in the event of its receivership, or the
insolvency of the parent or key affiliates. The analysis should reveal
the covered IDI's planning and gap analysis of its ability to separate
the covered IDI from the conglomerate structure in the most cost-
effective and timely fashion. The analysis and plan should reveal all
material obstacles to an orderly resolution of the covered IDI and
interconnections and interdependencies that would hinder the timely and
effective resolution of the insured entity, and set forth specific,
credible remediation steps or mitigating responses that would be
required to eliminate or minimize such obstacles.
    In developing an analysis and plan, a covered IDI should consider
the institution's size relative to its parent company structure; its
interdependence with the national and international marketplaces; as
well as how easily its financial company products or services can be
substituted.
Standards for Content of Contingent Resolution Plan
    The following set forth the minimum standards for the contingent
resolution plan to be provided by covered IDIs:
    <bullet> Provide sufficient information, covering material risks,
business lines, operations, activities and exposures of the covered IDI
and its subsidiaries necessary to permit development of an effective
contingent resolution plan.
    <bullet> Set forth the institution's analysis that identifies
material impediments to an orderly resolution of the covered IDI in the
event of its insolvency, the insolvency of its parent or critical
affiliates, and describing the steps that are or will be taken to
eliminate or mitigate such impediments.
    <bullet> Provide sufficient information to the FDIC to allow the
FDIC to isolate the IDI and to allow for effective resolution strategy
development and contingency planning for a period of severe financial
distress, describing means of preserving franchise value, maximizing
recovery to creditors, and minimizing systemic impacts on the financial
system.
    <bullet> Provide a gap analysis tailored to the size, complexity
and risk profile of the institution, provide remediation steps that are
feasible and capable of execution within a reasonable time frame and
set forth a time period within which remediation actions are to be
concluded.
    <bullet> The contingent resolution plan must be approved by the
institution's Board of Directors or designated executive committee.
    <bullet> The contingent resolution plan must be updated on a
regular, at least annual, basis, and demonstrate an ability to provide
current and updated information on material elements as described in
the regulation.
Minimum Components of the Required Contingent Resolution Plan
    The proposed rule prescribes the elements of a contingent
resolution plan intended to provide a complete review of the covered
IDI and its relationships with its parent and affiliates, and key
counterparties, to enhance preparedness for resolution. At a minimum
the contingent resolution plan should include the following elements:
    Summary of Analysis and Contingent Resolution Plan. Summarize
material impediments to an orderly resolution of the covered IDI
separate from its parent company and affiliates and a description of
specific, credible remedial or mitigating steps that are or would be
taken to eliminate or minimize such impediments. For example, reliance
upon affiliates to provide critical services can establish an
impediment to transferring its assets, liabilities and operations to an
acquiring institution or bridge bank. This gap may be remediated by the
development of continuity provisions in relevant contracts or by
establishing pre-arranged substitution for such services.
    Describe key assumptions underlying the analysis. Define short and
long-term goals to remediate or mitigate identified impediments to
separation and resolution.
    Organizational Structure. Includes the IDI's, parent company's, and
affiliates' legal and functional structures and identity of key
personnel tasked with managing major components within the organization
materially affecting the covered IDI.
    Business Activities, Relationships and Counterparty Exposures.
Identify and describe the business activities of the covered IDI and
its subsidiaries, including an explanation of material
interrelationships among the entities in the organizational structure,
e.g. major counterparties (especially for financial contracts) and
affiliates that provide key services and support. Critical services
that are provided by affiliates, such as servicing, information
technology support and operations, human resources or personnel should
be identified. This description should also provide an assessment of
each key entity's ability to function on a stand-alone basis.
    Capital Structure. Detail the covered IDI's capital structure, as
well as that of its parent, each subsidiary and key affiliates. Provide
complete financial information in the form of audited financial
statements presented along with line-item descriptions of the assets,
liabilities, and equity comprising the balance sheets of the parent
company as a consolidated entity as well as of each subsidiary or
affiliated entity. Describe corporate financing arrangements for the
institution, its subsidiaries, parent and key affiliates. Identify
funding, liquidity, and refinancing risks associated with the various
capital pools being utilized.
    Intra-Group Funding, Transactions, Accounts, Exposures and
Concentrations. Relative to the IDI, describe intra-group funding
relationships, accounts, and exposures, including terms, purpose, and
duration. These would include, for example, a description of intra-
group financial exposures, claims or liens, lending or borrowing lines
and relationships, guaranties, asset accounts, deposits or derivatives
transactions. Clearly identify the nature and extent to which the IDI's
parent or affiliates are to serve as a source of funding to the IDI,
the terms of any contractual arrangements, the location of related
assets, funds or deposits and the mechanisms by which funds can be
down-streamed from the parent to the IDI.
    Systemically Important Functions. Describe systemically important

[[Page 27468]]

functions that the covered IDI, its subsidiaries and affiliates
provide, including the nature and extent of the institution's
involvement in payment systems, custodial or clearing operations, large
sweep programs and capital markets operations in which it plays a
dominant role. Identify critical vulnerabilities, estimated exposure
and potential losses, and why certain attributes of the businesses
detailed in previous sections could pose a systemic risk to the broader
economy.
    Material Events. Describe events, e.g., acquisitions, sales,
litigation, operational and fiscal challenges, that have had a material
effect on the IDI and its relationship with its parent or affiliates.
    Cross-Border Elements. Discuss the nature and extent of the IDI's
cross-border interrelationships and exposures; describe individual
components of the group structure that are based or located outside the
United States, including foreign branches, subsidiaries and offices.
Provide detail on the location and amount of foreign deposits and
assets. This information is necessary to facilitate the FDIC's
determination of the legal and policy framework under which such assets
might be resolved in the event of insolvency, including the framework
for providing liquidity, the terms and restrictions of government
support, and the operational and technical challenges of international
payment systems.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The challenges related to cross-border resolutions, the
nature and extent of planning, and relevant information needs are
detailed in the Report and Recommendations of the Cross-border Bank
Resolution Group, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (March
2010); see especially Recommendation 6: ``Planning in advance for
orderly resolution''.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Any other material factor that may impede the orderly resolution of
the covered IDI separately from its parent and affiliates.
    Time frame for remediation. The plan should identify a time frame
within which identified remediation efforts shall be achieved.
    Approval. The covered IDI's board of directors or designated
executive committee must approve the analysis and plan and attest that
the plan is accurate and the information is current.
    No contingency resolution plan provided pursuant to this rule shall
be binding on the FDIC as receiver for a covered IDI.

II. Request for Comments

    The FDIC realizes that the proposed requirements for covered IDIs
could not be implemented without some regulatory and financial burden
on the industry. The FDIC is seeking to minimize the burden while
carrying out its mandates as insurer and as receiver. The FDIC seeks
comments on all aspects of the proposed rule. The FDIC seeks comment on
the potential industry costs and feasibility of implementing the
requirements of the proposed rule. The FDIC also is interested in
comments on whether there are other ways to accomplish its goals, or
other information that will further the objectives of this rulemaking.

III. Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et
seq.) (``PRA''), the FDIC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is
not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it
displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
control number. The estimated burden for the reporting and disclosure
requirements, as set forth in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, is as
follows:

the following requirements of this proposed rule constitute collections
of information as defined by the PRA: All covered IDIs are required to
submit to the FDIC a contingent resolution plan that contains certain
required information and meets certain described standards within six
months of the effective date of the proposed rule; updates to the
analysis and plan are required to be submitted annually, with certain
material information elements required to be updated more frequently as
reasonable and necessary. The collections of information contained in

IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA'') requires an agency
publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking to prepare and make
available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis
that describes the impact of the final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C.
603(a). Pursuant to regulations issued by the Small Business
Administration (13 CFR 121.201), a ``small entity'' includes a bank
holding company, commercial bank, or savings association with assets of
$165 million or less (collectively, small banking organizations). The
RFA provides that an agency is not required to prepare and publish a
regulatory flexibility analysis if the agency certifies that the
proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b).
    Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the FDIC
certifies that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule
would require the largest insured depository institutions to submit and
periodically update a contingent resolution plan. The proposed rule
would apply only to covered IDIs--defined in the proposed rule as
insured depository institutions with greater than $10 billion in total
assets that are owned or controlled by parent companies with more than
$100 billion in total assets. There are no small banking organizations
that would come within the definition of covered IDIs.

List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 360:

    Banks, Banking, Bank deposit insurance, Holding companies, National
banks, Participations, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,
Savings associations, Securitizations.

    For the reasons stated above, the Board of Directors of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation proposes to amend Part 360 of title 12 of
the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:

PART 360--RESOLUTION AND RECEIVERSHIP RULES

    1. The authority citation for part 360 is revised to read as
follows:

    Authority: 12 U.S.C. 1817(b), 1818(a)(2), 1818(t), 1819(a)
Seventh, Ninth and Tenth, 1820(b)(3), (4), 1821(d)(1),
1821(d)(10)(c), 1821(d)(11), 1821(e)(1), 1821(e)(8)(D)(i),
1823(c)(4), 1823(e)(2); Sec. 401(h), Pub. L 101-73, 103 Stat. 357.

    2. Add new Sec.  360.10 to read as follows:


Sec.  360.10.  Special reporting, analysis and contingent resolution
plans at certain large insured depository institutions.

    (a) Purpose and scope. This section is intended to ensure that the
FDIC has the information necessary to facilitate the orderly resolution
by the FDIC of a large insured depository institution (defined as a
``Covered Insured Depository Institution'' or ``CIDI''), upon its
failure, on a stand-alone basis, when the CIDI is part of a complex
financial organization that includes a corporate parent and, in most
cases, affiliates that are not depository institutions insured by the
FDIC. It also is intended to permit the FDIC to fulfill its legal
mandates as deposit insurer by facilitating assessment of insured
depository institutions' risk, and regarding the resolution of failed
insured depository institutions, to provide liquidity to depositors
promptly, enhance market discipline, ensure equitable treatment of
depositors at different insured depository institutions, and reduce the
FDIC's costs by preserving the franchise value of a failed insured
depository institution.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Affiliate has the same meaning given to such
term in Section 3(w)(6) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C.
1813(w)(6).
    (2) Covered Insured Depository Institution (CIDI) means an insured
depository institution with greater than $10 billion in total assets
that is owned or controlled by a parent company with more than $100
billion in total consolidated assets.
    (3) Non-Covered Insured Depository Institution means an FDIC-
insured depository institution that does not meet the definition of a
CIDI.
    (4) Parent company means any company that controls, directly or
indirectly, an insured depository institution.
    (5) Company has the same meaning given to such term in Sec.
362.2(d) of the FDIC's Regulations, 12 CFR 362.2(d).
    (6) Subsidiary has the same meaning given to such term in Section
3(w)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(w)(4).
    (7) Total assets are defined in the instructions for the filing of
Reports of Income and Condition and Thrift Financial Reports, as
applicable to the insured depository institution for determining
whether it qualifies as a CIDI.
    (c) Contingent Resolution Plans to be Submitted by CIDIs to FDIC--
(1) General. (i) Every CIDI, beginning on the effective date of this
section as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, must submit to
the FDIC, in a form and at a place to be prescribed, a contingent
resolution plan containing at least the information described in this
section, and meeting the standards described in this section. The
contingent resolution plan is to address the CIDI's ability to be
resolved in an orderly fashion in the event of its receivership, the
insolvency of the parent or key affiliates. The CIDI's contingent
resolution plan should discuss its ability to unwind or separate the
CIDI from the conglomerate structure in a cost-effective and timely
fashion. The plan should disclose material obstacles to an orderly
resolution of the CIDI, inter-connections and inter-dependencies that
hinder the timely and effective resolution of the CIDI, and include the
remediation steps or mitigating responses necessary to eliminate or
minimize such obstacles. The FDIC will review the plan in consultation
with the primary Federal regulator of the CIDI and the parent company
to determine whether the plan is workable and effective. FDIC may
reject the plan and require its resubmission if it fails to contain the
required information or otherwise fails to meet the standards
prescribed in this section.
    (ii) In developing the contingent resolution plan, CIDIs should
consider the institution's size relative to its parent company
structure, its interdependence with the national and international
marketplaces, as well as how easily its financial company products or
services can be substituted with the services of other organizations.
    (2) Use of existing documents; updating of analysis. The CIDI may
incorporate or include specific references to current reports or
publicly filed information.
    (3) Standards for Plan Content. The following set forth the minimum
standards for the contingent resolution plan to be provided by CIDIs:
    (i) Provide detailed information, covering material risks, business
lines, operations, activities and exposures of the CIDI and its
subsidiaries necessary to develop an effective contingent resolution
plan.

[[Page 27470]]

    (ii) Set forth the institution's analysis that identifies material
impediments to an orderly resolution of the CIDI in the event of its
insolvency, the insolvency of its parent or critical affiliates, and
describing the remediation or mitigating steps that are or will be
taken to eliminate or mitigate such impediments.
    (iii) Provide information to the FDIC to allow the isolation of the
CIDI and allow for effective resolution strategy development and
contingency planning for a period of severe financial distress,
describing means of preserving franchise value, maximizing recovery to
creditors, and minimizing systemic impacts on the financial system.
    (iv) The contingent resolution plan should be tailored to the size,
complexity and risk profile of the institution, provide remediation
steps that are feasible and capable of execution within a reasonable
time frame, and set forth a time period within which remediation
actions are to be concluded.
    (v) The analysis and plan must be approved by the institution's
Board of Directors or designated executive committee.
    (vi) The analysis and contingent resolution plan must be updated on
a regular, at least, annual, basis, and demonstrate an ability to
provide current and updated information on material elements described
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (4) Minimum Components of the Required Contingent Resolution Plan.
At a minimum the contingent resolution plan should include the
following elements:
    (i) Summary of Analysis and Contingent Resolution Plan. Summarize
the material impediments to an orderly resolution of the CIDI separate
from its parent and affiliates and a description of specific, credible
remedial or mitigating steps that are or would be taken to eliminate or
minimize such impediments. For example, reliance upon affiliates to
provide critical servicers can establish an impediment to transferring
the assets, liabilities and operations to an acquiring institution or
bridge bank. This gap may be remediated by the development of
continuity provisions in relevant contracts or by establishing pre-
arranged substitution for such services.
    (ii) Organizational Structure. Provide the IDI's, parent company's,
and affiliates' legal and functional structures, and identity of key
personnel tasked with managing major components within the organization
materially affecting the CIDI.
    (iii) Business Activities, Relationships and Counterparty
Exposures. Identify and describe the business activities of the CIDI
and its subsidiaries, along with an explanation of material inter-
relationships among the entities in the organizational structure (for
example, identification of major counterparties (especially for
financial contracts) and affiliates) that provide key services and
support. Critical services that are provided by affiliates, such as
servicing, human resources, information technology support and
operations, human resources or personnel should be identified. This
section should also provide an assessment of each material affiliate's
ability to function on a stand-alone basis.
    (iv) Capital Structure. Detail the CIDI's capital structure, as
well as that of its parent, each subsidiary, and key affiliates.
Provide complete financial information in the form of audited financial
statements presented along with line-item descriptions of the assets,
liabilities, and equity comprising the balance sheets of the parent
company as a consolidated entity as well as each CIDI. Describe
corporate financing arrangements for the institution, its subsidiaries,
parent and key affiliates. Identify funding, liquidity, refinancing and
concentration risks associated with the various capital pools being
utilized. Identify the key exposures to systemic risk and the
availability of a substitute that would mitigate the effect of a
systemic event.
    (v) Intra-Group Funding, Transactions, Accounts, Exposures and
Concentrations. Relative to the CIDI, describe intra-group funding
relationships, accounts, and exposures, including terms, purpose, and
duration. These would include, for example, a description of intra-
group financial exposures, claims or liens, lending or borrowing lines
and relationships, guaranties, asset accounts, deposits, or derivatives
transactions. Clearly identify the nature and extent to which the
CIDI's parent or affiliates are to serve as a source of funding to the
CIDI, the terms of any contractual arrangements, the location of
related assets, funds or deposits and the mechanisms by which funds can
be down-streamed from the parent to the CIDI.
    (vi) Systemically Important Functions. Describe systemically
important functions that the CIDI, its subsidiaries and affiliates
provide, including the nature and extent of the institution's
involvement in payment systems, custodial or clearing operations, large
sweep programs, and capital markets operations in which it plays a
dominant role. Discuss critical vulnerabilities, estimated exposure and
potential losses, and why certain attributes of the businesses detailed
in previous sections could pose a systemic risk to the broader economy.
    (vii) Material Events. Describe events, e.g., acquisitions, sales,
litigation, operational and fiscal challenges, that have had a material
affect on the IDI and its relationship with its parent company or
affiliates, since the last iteration of the analysis and plan.
    (viii) Cross-Border Elements. Discuss the nature and extent of the
CIDI's cross-border interrelationships and exposures; describe
individual components of the group structure that are based or located
outside the United States, including foreign branches, subsidiaries and
offices. Provide detail on the location and amount of foreign deposits
and assets. This information is necessary to facilitate the FDIC's
determination of the legal and policy framework under which such assets
might be resolved in the event of insolvency, including the framework
for providing liquidity, the terms and restrictions of government
support, and the operational and technical challenges of international
payment systems.
    (ix) Any other material factor that may impede the orderly
resolution of the CIDI separately from its parent and affiliates.
    (x) Time frame. The plan should identify a time frame within which
identified remediation efforts shall be achieved.
    (xi) Approval. The CIDI's board of directors or designated
executive committee must approve the analysis and plan and attest that
the plan is accurate and that the information is current.
    (5) No limiting effect on FDIC as receiver. No contingency
resolution plan provided pursuant to this rule shall be binding on the
FDIC as receiver for a covered IDI.
    (d) Implementation requirements. (1) The gap analysis and plan must
be submitted within 6 months of the effective date of the rule and must
be updated annually. FDIC may extend these deadlines in individual
cases for good cause shown. Material information elements must be
updated as necessary given the risk profile and structure of the
institution relative to its affiliates (e.g., deposit flows, intra-
group funding flows, short-term funding, derivatives transactions,
assets subject to market volatility; or material changes to capital
structure or sources).
    (2) An insured depository institution not within the definition of
a CIDI on the effective date of this section must comply with the
requirements of this section no later than 6 months following

[[Page 27471]]

the end of the second calendar quarter for which it meets the criteria
for a CIDI.
    (3) Upon the merger of two or more Non-CIDIs, if the resulting
institution meets the criteria for a CIDI, that CIDI must comply with
the requirements of this section no later than 6 months after the
effective date of the merger.
    (4) Upon the merger of two or more CIDIs, the merged institution
must comply with the requirements of this section within 6 months
following the effective date of the merger. This provision, however,
does not supplant any preexisting implementation date requirement, in
place prior to the date of the merger, for the individual CIDI(s)
involved in the merger.
    (5) Upon the merger of one or more CIDIs with one or more Non-
CIDIs, the merged institution must comply with the requirements of this
section within 6 months following the effective date of the merger.
This provision, however, does not supplant any preexisting
implementation date requirement for the individual CIDI(s) involved in
the merger.
    (6) Notwithstanding the general requirements of this paragraph (d),
on a case-by-case basis, the FDIC may accelerate, upon notice, the
implementation and updating time frames for all or part of the
requirements of this section.
    (7) FDIC may, upon application of a CIDI and for good cause shown,
modify or waive the minimum requirements set forth in this section for
that institution. ``Good cause'' shall mean that, because of the CIDI's
asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, scope of operations or
other relevant characteristics, the FDIC is able to determine that the
particular IDI does not, at the time of the application, appear to
present material resolution challenges or other unusual risk to the
Deposit Insurance Fund. Any such waiver or modification shall be
effective for one year.
    (e) Confidentiality of Information Submitted Pursuant to this
Section. Proprietary information and information which, if disclosed,
could endanger the institution's safety and soundness, should be
identified and segregated to the extent possible, and be accompanied by
a request for confidential treatment. Confidential information will not
be disclosed except as required by law.

    Dated at Washington, DC, this 11th day of May 2010.

    By order of the Board of Directors.
Robert E. Feldman,
Executive Secretary, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
