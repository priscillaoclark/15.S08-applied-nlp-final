SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 
3201 et seq.) (Interlocks Act or Act) prohibits individuals from 
simultaneously serving as a management official \1\ at two unaffiliated 
depository institutions or their holding companies (collectively, 
depository organizations) under certain circumstances. For example, 
section 203(1) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3202(1)) prohibits interlocks 
between unaffiliated depository organizations if each depository 
organization (or a depository institution affiliate thereof) has an 
office in the same relevant metropolitan statistical area (RMSA) (RMSA 
prohibition), unless each of the depository organizations involved has 
total assets below a specified threshold (small institution exception). 
Prior to enactment of the FSRRA, this asset threshold was $20 million. 
However, section 610 of the FSRRA amended the Interlocks Act by raising 
this asset threshold to $50 million, effective as of October 13, 
2006.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Each of the Agencies' regulations generally define 
``management official'' to include a director, an advisory or 
honorary director of a depository institution with total assets of 
$100 million or more, a senior executive officer, a branch manager, 
a trustee of a depository organization under the control of 
trustees, and any person who has a representative or nominee serving 
in such capacity. See 12 CFR 26.2(j) (OCC); 12 CFR 212.2(j) (Board); 
12 CFR 348.2(j) (FDIC); and 12 CFR 563f.2(j) (OTS).
    \2\ Pub. L. 109-351, Sec.  610, 120 Stat.--(Oct. 13, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Interim Rule

    The Agencies are amending their rules in order to implement section 
610 of the FSRRA. Specifically, the interim rules modify the RMSA 
prohibition to allow a management official of one depository 
organization to serve as a management official of an unaffiliated 
depository organization that has an office in the same RMSA as the 
first organization if each of the depository organizations in question 
(or a depository institution affiliate thereof) has total assets of 
less than $50 million.
    This interim rule also makes technical changes to correct 
inaccurate cross-references in the definition of management official in 
each of the Agencies' rules.

III. Regulatory Analysis

Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 4809) requires 
the Agencies to use ``plain language'' in all rules published in the 
Federal Register after January 1, 2000. The Agencies believe the 
interim rules are presented in a simple and straightforward manner.

Administrative Procedure Act

    The interim rule takes effect upon publication in the Federal 
Register. The interim rule implements a statutory change that took 
effect upon enactment on October 13, 2006. The new statutory provision 
itself gives the Agencies no discretion to modify the asset-size 
threshold for the small institution exception. The technical 
corrections of cross-references effected by the interim rule have no 
substantive effect. For the foregoing reasons, notice and public 
procedure are unnecessary. Accordingly, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b), 
the Agencies find good cause for making the rule effective as of 
January 11, 2007 without first seeking and reviewing public comment. 
However, the Agencies nonetheless invite public comment on the interim 
rule and will amend the rules if appropriate after reviewing public 
comments.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
(5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the regulatory flexibility analysis otherwise 
required under section 603 of the RFA (5 U.S.C. 603) is not required if 
the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
and the agency publishes such certification and a statement explaining 
the factual basis for such certification in the Federal Register along 
with its rule.
    Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, each of the Agencies 
certifies that this interim rule will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Agencies expect 
that this rule will not create any additional burden on small entities. 
The interim rule relaxes the criteria for obtaining an exemption from 
the RMSA prohibition, and specifically addresses the needs of small 
entities by allowing greater numbers of small organizations to qualify 
for the small institution exception from the RMSA prohibition. 
Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
3506; 5 CFR part 1320 Appendix A.1), the Agencies have determined that 
no collections of information pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
are contained in the interim rule.

OCC and OTS Executive Order 12866 Statement

    The OCC and OTS each have independently determined that the interim 
rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined in Executive 
Order 12866. Accordingly, a regulatory assessment is not required.

OCC and OTS Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995 Statement

    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1532), requires the OCC and OTS to prepare a budgetary impact statement 
before promulgating a rule that includes

[[Page 1276]]

a federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by state, local, 
and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of 
$100 million or more in any one year. However, this requirement does 
not apply to regulations that incorporate requirements specifically set 
forth in law. Because this interim rule implements section 610 of the 
FSRRA, the OTS and OCC have not conducted an Unfunded Mandates Analysis 
for this rulemaking.
